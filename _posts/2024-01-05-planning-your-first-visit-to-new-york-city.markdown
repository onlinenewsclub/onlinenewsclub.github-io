## Getting Ready 
As a first time visitor to New York City, there are some key things you need to do to prepare for your trip and make the most of your time exploring the greatest city in the world. Before arriving, take time to carefully study subway maps and get familiar with the overall layout of the city. [Focus your exploration within Manhattan on this initial visit](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-27-les-beaucoup-de-belles-choses-que-j-aime-lorsque-je-voyage-en-italie/) to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Look into hotel options in advance and book one that is centrally located, making it easy to explore on foot. When you first arrive, head straight to your hotel to settle in rather than stopping to sightsee so you can rest up before starting your adventures. 
### Transportation 
Unless staying in outer boroughs, **renting a car is not necessary in New York City**. The subway system, nicknamed "the trains", provides an efficient and affordable way to navigate within the city. Alternately, yellow cabs are plentiful if subways make you apprehensive. However, be aware that traffic can lead to high cab fares and long rides during peak times. No matter how you get around, always have subway or bus maps on hand for navigation.
