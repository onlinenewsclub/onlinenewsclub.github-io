### Experiencing Moscow's Warm Hospitality
As a **middle aged, blonde American woman**, I lived in Moscow for 3 years. During that time, I walked and took the metro everywhere I went since I did not have a car. I lived on the Garden Ring [popular residential area](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-24-trinidad-une-xeele-aux-contrastes-saisissants/) in central Moscow. Despite walking home alone and drunk more than once, I never experienced any street crime. Russians in Moscow were just normal, friendly people going about their daily lives. We were simply nobodies to them so no one was interested in harassing us. 
My husband speaks Russian fluently, so every time we asked for directions on the street like locals do, we were taken under the wings of protective strangers and escorted to our destinations. People exhibited incredible warmth and hospitality towards us. When my husband's wallet was once stolen, a park worker recognized him months later and kindly returned his wallet with photos and documents intact, minus the cash. This accurately reflects the kind treatment we received from Moscow residents.

### Safe and Convenient Transportation Options 
During our recent family trip to Moscow, we relied on the services of CabExpresso for all of our transportation needs in the city. Their pre-booked taxi services ensured a safe and comfortable traveling experience for my wife and kids. The professional drivers were well-versed with the city's layout, getting us to tourist attractions and accommodation with minimal hassle. This allowed us to freely explore and enjoy Moscow without anxiety over transportation. Unlike taking public transports during rush hours, CabExpresso's private vehicles alleviated safety concerns for our little ones.

Proper winter clothing, limiting outdoor activities and flexible budgeting are crucial for an enjoyable winter trip.
