While travelling within India, it is permitted to carry cigarettes for personal consumption. However, there are certain restrictions placed on carrying lighters and matchboxes on domestic flights and trains within the country. Letâ€™s take a deeper look at the rules and regulations around transporting cigarettes and related items when traveling domestically in India.
### Cigarette Quantity Allowances
Passengers are allowed to carry up to [two hundred cigarettes](https://travelokie.github.io/2024-01-03-which-computer-brand-is-best-a-comparative-analysis/) or **fifty cigars or five hundred grams of tobacco** for personal consumption when traveling domestically within India. Any quantities exceeding these limits would be considered commercial quantities and may attract duties or penalties. It is advisable to carry the cigarettes, cigars or tobacco in their original factory sealed packing with printed MRP to avoid issues.

### Restrictions on Carrying Lighters and Matchboxes 
While cigarettes in reasonable personal use quantities are permitted onboard trains and domestic flights within India, **lighters and matchboxes are strictly prohibited** on all public transportation for safety reasons. This is a precautionary measure to prevent any possible fire hazards that could arise from carrying igniting devices. Passengers are advised to not pack lighters or matches in their hold baggage or hand baggage when traveling by air or rail within the country. 
### Procedure to Submit Lighters at Airport Security Checks
If passengers are found carrying lighters at airport security checkpoints during boarding, they will be asked to surrender the lighters. The airport authorities maintain boxes at security points where passengers can deposit lighters that are then returned to them after deplaning at their destination airport. This allows travelers to safely dispose of lighters during air travel while still having them for use once they reach their destination.
### Common Practice of Additional Cigarette Carton by Gulf Returnees
It is a widespread non-compliant practice followed by many Indian expatriates **returning from Gulf countries** to purchase three cartons (each containing twenty packs) of cigarettes from duty free shops rather than the permitted two cartons. This is because the third carton is often confiscated by Indian Customs authorities upon arrival as an "informal gift". While technically illegal, this undeclared extra carton is tacitly accepted as a petty bribe by customs staff inspecting returning NRIs' baggage.
### Consequences of Non-compliance 
While minor violations regarding carrying matches or exceeding cigarette packet limits are usually overlooked, transporting **commercial quantities** of tobacco products like multiple cartons without paying applicable duties can attract **penalties under Indian customs laws**. Travellers must be aware of the legal limits and procedures to avoid the risk of **fines or even confiscation of goods and prosecution** if found transporting tobacco in amounts indicating commercial intent rather than personal use. It is always best to travel fully compliant with regulations to have a smooth journey.
### Recommendations for Safe and Compliance Travel 
In summary, the key recommendations for safely transporting cigarettes and avoiding issues are:
- Carry cigarettes within the **personal limits of 200 cigarettes or equivalent**
- Do **not pack any lighters or matches** in carry-on or checked baggage for flights or trains
- At airports, **deposit lighters at security** checkpoints for collection after travel  
- Be aware that **undeclared excess limits may attract penalties** under customs laws
- Follow regulations to ensure a **worry-free journey** within India.
By keeping these rules and procedures in mind, travelers will be compliant while transporting cigarettes for personal use and avoid unnecessary hassles during domestic transportation across India. Let the authorities do their duty vigilantly while travelers focus on enjoying their travels smoothly within the country.
