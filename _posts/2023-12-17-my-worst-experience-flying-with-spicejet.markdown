Traveling to see my loved ones should be a joyful time. However, my experience flying with SpiceJet turned it into a nightmare. From delays and lost baggage to rude staff and fraudulent charges, SpiceJet failed at every turn to provide a quality customer experience. This is the story of how one airline ruined what should have been a special reunion.
### A Lengthy Separation  
My sister and I lived nearly 1,200 miles apart while she pursued her higher education. As a young girl, it was difficult being separated from my mother for so long. Every other month, my father would book the only available flights between our hometown and my sister's college city - SpiceJet.

We looked forward to these precious reunions, but SpiceJet had other plans.
Their first mistake was delaying our outbound flight, causing us to miss our connecting bus. We arrived late and had to spend the night in an unfamiliar place. On the return trip, their baggage handlers misplaced our luggage, leaving us to search different conveyor belts for hours. **Airline baggage handling problems**. SpiceJet seemingly did everything possible to prolong our separation.

### Fraud and Mistreatment  
Tired of the hassle, my father paid extra to pre-book our seats together. But at check-in, SpiceJet charged us again and ushered us to "premium" exit row seats for an exorbitant fee. Only later did they unceremoniously kick me out for being underage. **Airline deceptive booking practices.** Their attendant berated my father in front of the jeering passengers. Humiliated and distressed, I switched to an uncomfortable economy seat, feeling like a criminal for SpiceJet's deceit. 
For a child, this traumatic experience left deep scars. I lost faith that corporations could treat customers, especially families, with dignity and respect. The staff showed no empathy for our situation and refusedresponsibility for their fraudulent up-sell. This further strained my limited time with loved ones.
### More Delays and Discomforts
On our return, SpiceJet again delayed the flight by several hours without explanation or apology. **Poor on-time flight performance.** We sat stranded at the airport, worried about missing important plans. When we finally boarded, I received a broken food tray and had to sit separately from my father again. Simple courtesies like meal quality and seating preferences, important for a young passenger's security and comfort, were nowhere to be found. 
After so many logistical and customer service nightmares, I dreaded SpiceJet flights. Each trip with them chipped away at precious family bonding time and bruised my view of the airline industry
### A Refusal to Fly Them Again  
To this day, the memory of SpiceJet's misconduct and incompetence remains seared in my mind. **Negative customer experience impact.** No compensation could erase the distress of that young girl alone at the airport or suffering public shaming. My father vowed never to fly with them again after their complete disregard for our well-being, time and money. 
While other carriers also face operational challenges, basic human decency and truthfulness should not falter. Through it all, SpiceJet gaslit and blamed customers instead of accepting responsibility. For putting profits over people during what was meant to be a joyous reunion, they earned my permanent boycott. No family deserves such mistreatment, especially by an industry tasked with safely transporting lives.
### A Hope for Accountability
Over a decade later, reports show SpiceJet continues struggling with delays, cancellations and safety issues. **Airline industry problems.** As a consumer advocate, I can only hope regulators and competitors apply sufficient pressure to reform questionable practices harming passengers. No company should operate without dignity, transparency or accountability for how their decisions traumatize lives. 
While nostalgia remains for family trips of youth, the memory of SpiceJet brings only bitterness. Time may heal wounds, but justice demands we learn from mistakes and prevent future suffering. In that spirit, I share my story so others may avoid a similar nightmare, and to remind all corporations that people, not profits, should be the top priority in any service industry.
