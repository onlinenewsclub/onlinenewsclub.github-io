### My Hometown Wuwei 
Wuwei is a county-level city located in Anhui Province with a GDP per capita of around $5000 USD in 2016. Some key landmarks include the Wuwei Railway Station which has provided more convenient transportation for locals and enabled economic growth. The city is slowly developing but remains fairly small compared to larger Chinese cities.

### Studying at Anqing University
I am currently studying for my university degree at Anqing University, located in the larger city of Anqing. Anqing has a long history but as a fourth-tier city, it has experienced some economic decline in recent years. However, I was immediately drawn to its cleanliness and advanced civilization. I believe Anqing has great potential for growth as China continues to develop rapidly. Some iconic sites in Anqing include the [main Anqing Railway Station](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-04-u8003-u5bdf-u8d1d-u5b81-u57ce-u4e00-u4e2a-u5145-u6ee1-u6d3b-u529b-u7684-u57ce-u5e02/) which connects the city to other parts of China.
### Campus Life Amidst the Pandemic  
Campus life has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year. Strict measures like quarantines and travel restrictions were initially put in place. However, restrictions are gradually being eased as the situation improves. Students can now travel between towns and foreign students may soon be able to receive Chinese vaccines. Temperature checks are still required on campus along with masks on public transport. Cafes and gathering spots like the library remain open but with limits on capacity.
### Exploring Anqing City
When not in classes, I enjoy exploring different areas of Anqing city. The clean rivers and banks provide scenic views and spots for hiking or picnics. During autumn, the changing colors of maple trees in riverside parks are especially beautiful. I also love visiting the many parks dotted throughout the city where you can find attractions like kite flying or street food vendors. The extensive subway system also allows convenient travel around the urban areas.   
### Modern Amenities 
While Anqing retains its traditional charm, it also offers many modern conveniences. Easy access to necessities like wifi, charging stations and convenience stores have made daily life quite smooth. The subway provides a green and affordable way to get around the city. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure is also being expanded to pave the way for sustainable transportation. Libraries on university campuses are well-equipped studying spots that go beyond just books with amenities like cafes.
### Cultural Exchanges on Campus
As an international student, I have appreciated opportunities for cultural exchange. Many universities in China actively promote programs that connect domestic and foreign students. This could include joint cultural activities, language exchange programs or social gatherings. It has been very interesting learning about other cultures and making friends from places like Korea, Japan or other parts of the world right here in Anqing city. Such diversity has enriched my overall university experience in China.
