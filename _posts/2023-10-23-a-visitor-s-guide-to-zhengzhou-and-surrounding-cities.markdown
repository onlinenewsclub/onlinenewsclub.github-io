### Advice for foreign visitors  
A warning for foreign visitors - certain areas like **Yiyang, Luanchuan and Song Counties** near Luoyang are completely off-limits even for those holding work visas due to military installations. While attractions in these areas may be advertised, checking maps carefully is crucial to avoid restricted zones. Also be aware some site tickets and hotels may be sold to foreigners despite the prohibition - confirming access is permitted is important before visiting. With these precautions in mind, travelers can safely explore Henan's riches from Zhengzhou using reliable tour guides or translation apps. Zhengzhou and its surrounding areas offer deep cultural experiences - plan thoroughly to navigate restrictions and immerse fully.
