### Cheap Underground Option
The cheapest way to get to downtown Shanghai from Pudong International Airport is by taking the underground metro. Single ride tickets on the underground typically cost between 10 to 15 Chinese yuan (CNY), which is around $1.50-$2.25 USD. The metro runs frequently, around every 5-10 minutes during peak hours, providing a convenient and affordable option. The journey takes approximately 45-60 minutes depending on the line and destination within downtown. Be mindful of the last train times, as the underground stops operating around 22:30 every night.

### Fast Maglev Train 
For a quicker trip, consider taking the **super high-speed maglev train**. The maglev utilizes magnetic levitation technology to reach top speeds of over 260 mph, making it the fastest train in commercial service worldwide. It takes just 7-8 minutes to reach Longyang Road metro station from Pudong Airport using the maglev. From there, a short underground ride on the metro can get you to various downtown destinations. The total travel time on the maglev-metro combo is around 45-50 minutes. Maglev tickets are about CNY 50 but you can get a small discount of around CNY 10 if you have an air ticket. Note that the last maglev departs at 21:30.
### Taxis for Flexibility
If you have heavier luggage or missed the last trains, taxis provide a flexible 24/7 option. However, expect to pay around CNY 200-250 for the 30-60 minute trip depending on traffic conditions. While pricey compared to public transit, taxis ensure a private and direct ride without transfers. Make sure to book through a compliant operator like Didi to avoid scams. Consider bargaining for the rate if traveling outside of rush hour.
### Long Distance Bus and Train Options
For cost-conscious travel from further destinations within China, consider taking an overnight bus or high-speed train instead of a flight. While longer, fares start as low as CNY 50-100 each way on sleeper buses or trains compared to CNY 500+ for a budget airline ticket. Online booking platforms like [China Bus Ticket](https://thetopnews.github.io/mastering-basketball-tips-for-consistent-performance-in-any-game/) and **China Train Ticket** allow seamless reservations. Buses terminate at the Shanghai South Bus Station near downtown while trains arrive at Hongqiao Railway Station, both well connected to the subway network.
### International Flight Options into Shanghai  
If flying internationally into Shanghai, the main airport is Pudong International Airport (PVG), which services the majority of long-haul flights into the city. Look for non-stop flights or those with a single connection using search engines like Skyscanner. Another airport option is Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA), but flights there often require a stopover from overseas. For even cheaper international tickets, consider flying into nearby airports in cities like Hangzhou or Guangzhou then completing the final leg by bus or train. Just factor in the additional travel time versus convenience.
### Overall Recommendations
For a local experience, take the fast and frequent maglev into downtown then transfer to the metro (CNY 50 total). If time is limited, taxis provide assured arrival within 30-60 minutes for CNY 200-250. More cost effectively, consider overnight buses or trains from within China for as low as CNY 50-100 instead of short domestic flights. Flex your schedule for cheaper bus/train tickets booked directly at stations. Overall, public transit beat taxis for value while offering different trade-offs versus flexibility.
### Other Notes
- Shanghai also has convenient car rental options through services like Easzycar if traveling within the city. Rates start around CNY 150-200 per day. 
- For a smooth airport pickup, book a private transfer service in advance through 58 airport transfers for fixed rates.
- Be mindful of your luggage limits and pack light if taking the metro or bus for flexibility. Storage lockers available if needed.
