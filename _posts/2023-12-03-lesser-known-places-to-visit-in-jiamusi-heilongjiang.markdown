### Enjoy Nature at Sifeng Mountain
Sifeng Mountain is a small mountain located just outside of Jiamusi city. While not very tall, it offers visitors beautiful natural scenery. There is a reservoir at the base of the mountain with a small island in the middle. Those wanting a more active experience can rent a barbecue grill and cook their own meal beside the dyke overlooking the water. For those interested in culture and religion, there is also a Buddhist temple called the [Yufo Temple](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-ub791-uc2a4-ub530-uc639-ube44-uc5e5-uc5d0-uc11c-uc758-uc5ec-ud589-uacbd-ud5d8/) located on the mountain, though its exact location may require asking locals for directions. The mountain offers a nice escape from the city into tranquil natural surroundings.

### Relax at Xinglinhu Park
Xinglinhu Park is one of the best spots in Jiamusi for taking a break and relaxing. As a normal city park, it has plenty of open grassy areas perfect for picnicking or simply enjoying some leisure time outdoors. Many locals fondly remember spending summer evenings relaxing on the lawn here when they were younger. Even on a busy day, the atmosphere remains quite peaceful. It's the ideal place to escape the bustle of daily life and unwind for a while.  
### Stroll Along the Riverside
Stretching along the river that runs through Jiamusi is a scenic park called Yanjiang Park. More commonly just called "Jiangbian" or "riverside" by locals, it has been a popular recreational area for citizens for decades. Covering the space from the railroad bridge all the way to Qingnian Square in the center of town, there is plenty of space to walk, jog, or simply sit and take in the river views. On weekends it fills with locals socializing, playing games, or participating in other outdoor activities. A stroll here is a great way to experience scenic city life.
### Enjoy the Views of Jiangbei
Across the river from the main part of Jiamusi is the recreational area known as Jiangbei. Most appealing to families with children, it has playgrounds, picnic areas, and other kid-friendly attractions. One unique way to access it is to take a passenger ship from the downtown area, offering views of the river during the short trip. Developed as a public leisure zone, it sees fewer visitors nowadays but still offers scenic walking trails and parkland perfect for relaxing in nature.
### Experience Rural Life in Jiaxi 
A bit further from the city center is the rural town of Jiaxi. While less developed than Jiamusi, it offers visitors a taste of traditional countryside life. Dotted with fields, farms, and quiet villages, Jiaxi has managed to retain much of its old charm despite modern development elsewhere. Those interested in agriculture or simply wanting a change of pace from the city can spend a day exploring the rural landscapes and architecture of Jiaxi. Visitors can also interact directly with local farmers and see manufacturing of traditional farm products like tofu or pickled vegetables. It provides urban residents a rare opportunity to experience Heilongjiang's agricultural heritage.
### Visit the Buddhist Temple of Yuanhai 
For those wanting a destination further afield, the historic Buddhist temple Yuanhai offers a culturally and spiritually enriching trip. Located approximately two hours by car from Jiamusi in a scenic mountainous area, it is one of the most renowned temples in the region. Visitors can explore its grand courtyard architecture reflecting Ming and Qing dynasty styles, admire traditional decorative art, or even attend meditation sessions or religious ceremonies. With a scenic backdrop of surrounding forested hills, Yuanhai Temple creates a serene natural environment ideal for reflection or escaping daily concerns. It makes for a memorable excursion outside the city for those interested in religious culture.
### Don't Forget the Local Snacks
No visit to Jiamusi is complete without sampling the many street snacks and specialties the city is known for. Eating is as much a part of local culture and way of life here as sightseeing. Some dishes especially worth trying include scallion pancakes, beef noodle soup, smoked fish, dumplings, and Asian pear desserts. Markets, restaurants and small shops selling local snacks can be found all over the city, especially in the busy commercial districts downtown near Qingnian Square. Indulging in new culinary discoveries is not just about sustaining energy for sightseeing, but truly experiencing the vibrant local cuisine and culture of Jiamusi.
