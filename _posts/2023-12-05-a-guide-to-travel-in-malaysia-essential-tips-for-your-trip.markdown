Applying for a Malaysian visa can be done online through their government website. The eNTRI visa allows 14 days of visitation for about $20 USD. Photos sized 35mm by 50mm are required. Approval typically takes 3-4 days after uploading all required documents and photos. Be sure to print the approval notice and carry it along with your passport upon arrival in Malaysia.

### **Booking flights and accommodations**
When booking flights, be sure to check baggage allowance policies to avoid surprise fees. Low-cost carriers like AirAsia only include carry-on for their lowest fares. Hotels in the Bukit Bintang neighborhood offer good value and location in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. Booking accommodations in advance ensures availability at popular destinations.
### **Getting from the airport into the city** 
The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is well connected to the city. **Air-conditioned buses** run between the airport and downtown KL for about 12 Malaysian Ringgit each way, taking an hour. The **KL Express train** is faster at around 25 minutes for 55 Ringgit. Grab is a reliable **e-hailing taxi service** starting around 65 Ringgit into the city.
## Arrival and Getting Settled
### **Transit from the airport**
Upon arrival, proceed through customs where luggage is scanned. Exchange money at shopping malls for a better rate than the airport. Purchase a tourist SIM card like Maxis Hotlink for under 35 Ringgit from shops near the arrival gates.  
### **Transportation within Kuala Lumpur**
The transit system includes **train, bus and monorail lines**. Download the Grab app for inexpensive and convenient **e-hailing taxi** services anytime. Regular taxis use meters but can be more expensive than Grab. Stick to well-lit main roads at night for walking. 
### **Currency, costs, and cash** 
The Malaysian currency is the Ringgit, exchanging around 5 Ringgit to 1 USD. ATMs have a maximum 1500 Ringgit withdrawal and 5000 Ringgit daily limit. Most places accept credit cards but keep some cash on hand. Daily costs are very reasonable, with meals often under 10 Ringgit and drinks around half that.
## Exploring the City
### **Iconic landmarks in the capital**
Don't miss the impressive Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC). Take the **skybridge between the towers** for panoramic views. Nearby Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square) features historic buildings like the Royal Selangor Club. The **Menara KL Tower** offers a bird's eye panorama up high.
### **Shopping, dining, and nightlife** 
Begin at bustling Central Market for crafts and souvenirs. Nearby **Petaling Street** (China Town) is filled with shops, street food stalls and street performers. For dining, the **Sarvanna Bhawan** food court in Suria KLCC serves authentic South Indian cuisine. Jalan Alor is lively at night with many hawker stalls. Rooftop bars like **Heli Lounge** have stunning nighttime cityscapes.
### **Day trips from the city**
Spend a full day exploring the **caves, temples and orangutans** at Genting Highlands, accessible by cable car or road. Port Dickson offers beaches less than an hour's drive away. The **Batu Caves** north of KL are a colorful Hindu temple complex worth the train ride.
## Practical Tips
### **Safety, etiquette and cultural norms**  
Malaysia maintains very low crime rates. However, use caution in unpopulated areas at night. Dress and behave respectfully in places of worship. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. Be mindful of **cultural and religious sensitivities** regarding attire, photos etc around mosques. 
### **Communications and technology**
International data plans work but local SIM cards provide cheaper data. Free wifi is available in many public places and cafes. Grab the **transit app** Moovit for navigation on public transportation. Most signs and menus include English translations. Speak English to get by, but basic Malay greetings are always appreciated.
### **Health and emergencies**
No vaccinations required aside from standard precautions. Tap water is generally safe to drink. Pharmacies are well-stocked. Major hospitals have English-speaking doctors. Dial 999 for police, fire and ambulance services in an emergency.
## Packing Essentials 
### **What to bring**
Pack lightweight clothing suitable for tropical weather, a portable power bank, medical and personal items, majority of cash in small denominations and a money pouch. Bring adapters and spare chargers for devices. Carry photocopies of passport, visas and insurance documents separately from your passport.  
### **Currency exchange and ATMs**
Bring some US Dollars, Pounds or Euros for initial expenses. Major credit cards and bank ATM/debit cards work well. Notify your bank before travel to avoid blocked transactions abroad. Exchange larger bills at banks, money changers at malls offer better rates than airports.
