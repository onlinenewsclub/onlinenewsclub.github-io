### Planning the Route 
As you set out from Brisbane heading southeast towards Melbourne, you'll want to plan your route carefully to maximize scenic coastal views while balancing driving time. [coastal scenic Australian road trip planning](https://thetopnews.github.io/how-interior-design-reflects-personal-style-and-changes-through-the-years/) requires considering where to break up the almost 1900km journey. Going entirely along the coast will extend your drive by over 3 hours compared to the more direct inland route. However, the coastal route offers unbeatable beauty and plenty of spots for rest and replenishment along the way. With a mix of coastal and inland stretches, you can balance time and sights.

### Day 1: Brisbane to Coffs Harbour 
Leaving Brisbane, your first day will take you just over 10 hours as you travel down the coast. For the first part of the drive, stick to the coast along the Pacific Highway for gorgeous ocean vistas. Consider stopping in Gold Coast towns like Coolangatta or Burleigh Heads to refuel and wander the beaches. As you pass through Byron Bay, resist lingering too long in the town's charming shops and beaches to stay on schedule. Continue south to Coffs Harbour, a charming coastal city surrounded by nature reserves, for your first overnight stay. 
### The Waterfall Way to Armidale
Rather than taking the direct inland route after Coffs Harbour, opt for the scenic Waterfall Way through the hinterland. Twisting through rainforests and past cascading waterfalls, this route typifies the region's natural beauty. Stop in Dorrigo National Park to stretch your legs amidst the Gondwana Rainforests. Continue west to Armidale for the evening. Set in a fertile valley, this historic rural city makes for a pleasant stopover. 
### Wine Country in the Upper Hunter Valley
Leaving Armidale, head south through Tamworth and onto the **Upper Hunter Valley wine region**. Known globally for vineyards and cool climate wines, slow down here to sample some drops. Spend the evening in the charming village of Muswellbrook, with arts, dining and accommodation options galore. This peaceful area offers the perfect backdrop to relax after a long day of scenic drives.
### Day 2: Through the Goulburn River National Park  
Rise early for the sunrise over the vineyards and continue south through fertile farmland. Your destination today is Bathurst, but first take a detour on your way through the **Goulburn River National Park**. Wind your way along the river through tranquil bushland dotted with picnic spots. After working up an appetite, continue onto Bathurst for lunch beside Mount Panorama. Pay your respects to this iconic racing circuit before pushing on.
### Crossing the Border into Albury-Wodonga
The wide open spaces of the inland road beckon as you motor west from Bathurst along quiet country lanes. Pass through picturesque Cowra, home to Australia's largest Japanese garden, then keep heading towards the Victorian border. Your destination today is Albury-Wodonga, which straddles the Murray River border. Spend the evening relaxing after another scenic day of driving through varied Australian landscapes.
### The Final Leg to Melbourne
Rise early for the last driving day of your epic trip. The M31 Freeway whisks you effortlessly into Victoria and towards Melbourne. Take in rural gold rush towns and working dairy farms along the way. As you near Australia's second largest city, consider stopping for lunch in the Yarra Valley wine region for a taste of local produce. Refuel both body and vehicle before hitting busy city streets. Take the final 2 hour drive into Melbourne, mission accomplished after three memorable days on the road. Celebrate your coastal road trip with a relaxing dinner overlooking Port Phillip Bay!
### Rules for Safe and Enjoyable Driving 
No road trip would be complete without safe driving practices. When planning stops, aim for regular breaks every two hours to rest eyes and body. **Road trip safety Australian driving tips** include filling up with fuel well before the tank hits a quarter, and avoiding rural driving after dusk to minimize wildlife collisions. Pack essentials like maps, water, snacks and a first aid kit. Most importantly, start early and leave plenty of time between destinations to truly relax and appreciate this stunning coastline from Brisbane to Melbourne. Happy and safe travels!
