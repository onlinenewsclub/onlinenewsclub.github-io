## Travel Essentials
When traveling to a foreign country, it's important to be prepared with the proper documentation. Make sure to have [valid travel documents such as your passport and visa](https://codeoffers.github.io/2024-01-05-u0928-u093f-u0915-u093e-u0930-u093e-u0917-u0941-u0906-u092f-u093e-u0924-u094d-u0930-u093e-u0915-u09/) ready for presentation at all times. Familiarize yourself with the local currency, the Peruvian Sol. I recommend bringing **both cash and debit/credit cards** to give flexibility in accessing funds during your trip.
## Transportation
For transportation around Lima, I highly recommend using the ride-hailing app **InDriver**. This allows you to set your desired fare upfront so you avoid **overpaying due to speaking with an accent**. **Taxi drivers may try to charge more** if they hear you speaking English as a foreigner. **InDriver lets you negotiate and confirm rates in advance.**
### **Neighborhoods to Stay In** 
Of the major districts in Lima, **Miraflores is considered the safest and nicest area** with many excellent restaurants and shops. **Barranco can be hit or miss depending on the specific location**. Some great options for accommodation include **Airbnbs, which offer a local experience and advice from your host.**

## Top Attractions
### Larcomar Mall
Located right on the Pacific coast, **Larcomar is a great spot to relax with shopping and dining**. The surrounding area around the mall is also very **upscale and safe to walk around**.
### Circuito MÃ¡gico del Agua 
This park offers stunning **water fountains and multimedia shows set to music and lights**. While the park itself is safe during the day, **I don't recommend wandering the surrounding neighborhoods alone at night**. 
## Cultural Sights
### Plaza de Armas de Lima
In downtown Lima you'll find this beautiful central plaza with historic buildings like the **presidential palace and cathedral housing the catacombs**. Note that **downtown Lima is not totally safe - go during the day and take taxis between locations**.
### Real San Felipe Fortress
This colonial military fortress in Callao allows night tours for those who enjoy **creepy history**. However, **Callao is not a safe area - arrange transport directly from the fort entrance.**
## Budgeting and Dining
On a budget of around **$50-75 USD per day**, you'll have no problem covering accommodation, transportation, attractions and meals. **Peruvian cuisine is quite affordable**, with main dishes generally $8-15 each. Some of the most authentic local specialties to try include **ceviche and chifa (Chinese-Peruvian) cuisine**. Lima has some of the best Chinese food outside of Asia.
I hope these travel tips help you get the most out of your trip to Lima, Peru while staying safe! Let me know if you have any other questions.
