### Arrival Visa and Pre-Registration for Indian Nationals
Indian passport holders entering Hong Kong for tourism and business purposes are allowed to stay for up to 14 days without a visa. However, they are now required to complete an online Pre-Arrival Registration (PAR) before traveling. The PAR can be completed on the website of the Immigration Department of Hong Kong at https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/pre-arrival_registration_for_indian_nationals.html. The result is provided instantly. Travelers need to print the registration and carry it along with their valid Indian passport for immigration clearance in Hong Kong. The PAR is valid for 6 months and allows multiple entries within that period, with each stay not exceeding 14 days.

### Planning Your Itinerary in Hong Kong
There are several must-see attractions and areas to explore in the bustling city of Hong Kong. For travel inspiration and guidance on building an itinerary, check out The Unconventional Girl blog at https://theunconventionalgirlblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/30/hongkong-skyline/. The blog provides tips on visiting landmarks like the [Big Buddha statue](https://thetopnews.github.io/choosing-the-right-gym-for-your-needs-and-budget/) on Lantau Island as well as riding the historic **Peak Tram** for panoramic views of the skyline. Recommendations are also given for exploring the markets and restaurants in areas such as **Mongkok** and experiencing the vibrant nightlife at **Ladies' Market** and **Temple Street Night Market**.
### Visiting Landmarks and Attractions 
Two of the most iconic landmarks to visit are Victoria Peak and Ocean Park. Ride the historic Peak Tram for breathtaking 360-degree views of the city from Victoria Peak. Alternatively, brave souls can climb up the 300 steps. Ocean Park is a massive oceanarium and amusement park located on the southern side of Hong Kong Island. It is one of the most popular attractions in the city, home to exhibits of marine life, thrill rides and live entertainment. No trip is complete without sampling dim sum at a local restaurant. Check restaurant menus in advance and look for pictures to order some popular dishes like hairy crab, bamboo clams and shrimp dumplings.  
### Exploring the Markets
Foodies will enjoy exploring the vibrant wet markets and night markets dotted across Hong Kong. In Mongkok, spend the morning at the local vegetable market getting a glimpse into Hong Kong's fresh produce. Come evening, Temple Street Night Market and Ladies' Market offer a lively shopping experience under strings of lights. Browse stalls selling clothing, accessories and souvenirs. Be sure to stop for snacks like egg waffles, barbecued skewers and coconut jelly. Bargain hunting is mandatory, so bring your best haggling skills. Another top spot is the goldfish market in Mongkok where you'll find rows of glass tanks filled with colorful koi varieties.
### Macau: The Las Vegas of Asia
A day trip from Hong Kong takes you to the special administrative region of Macau, just an hour away by turbojet. Dubbed the "Las Vegas of Asia", Macau is a big gambling destination with glitzy casino resorts like Wynn Macau, Sands Macau and The Venetian Macao. While gambling may not interest all visitors, Macau offers other attractions like the ruins of Saint Paul's, Senado Square and Monte Fort. Foodies will love sampling Macanese cuisine, a unique blend of Portuguese and Chinese flavours. Be sure to try favorites like African chicken, pork chop buns and baked pork ribs. An overnight stay allows experiencing the charm of Macau after dark. 
### Culture, Heritage and Nature Spots  
To experience Hong Kong's culture and history, visit the Hong Kong Museum of History in Tsim Sha Tsui for exhibits tracing the development of Hong Kong from a fishing village to a modern metropolis. Nature lovers can escape the bustle with a trip to the Outlying Islands. Restful Lamma Island is a scenic getaway just an hour from Central by ferry. Hike forest trails and relax on Calm beaches. For a refreshing break amid lush greenery, head to the Tai Tam Reservoir located in the New Territories region. Considered the “lungs” of Hong Kong, it offers easy walking trails through thick forest areas and idyllic picnic spots. 
### Planning Your Budget Trip 
Hong Kong is not a budget-friendly destination for long stays due to the high cost of accommodations and dining out. However, smart planning and choosing affordable options can help cut costs. Stay in a basic hostel, consider homestays on sites like Airbnb, and opt for local inexpensive meals over expensive tourist restaurants. Make use of the efficient and affordable public transport system with the Octopus card to travel between destinations. Download discount deals and free entertainment options on the Discover Hong Kong app. With strategy and flexibility, it's possible to experience the highlights of this vibrant city on a modest budget.
### Entry Immigration Requirements  
Upon arrival at the immigration checkpoint in Hong Kong, present your valid Indian passport along with the printed PAR registration slip. You will be granted entry and issued a landing slip entitling you to stay for up to 14 days. Visitors are not allowed paid or unpaid employment during their stay. If you need to stay beyond 14 days, apply for a Hong Kong visa from the Immigration Department before travel. Remember that the PAR is only for tourism/social visits of up to two weeks - you cannot use it to immigrate, work or study in Hong Kong. Strict compliance with entry rules will ensure a hassle-free trip.
