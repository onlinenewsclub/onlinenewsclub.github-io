### Reaching Port Blair
I started my trip with an overnight journey from Delhi to Kolkata and then a connecting flight to Port Blair. Reaching the airport in Port Blair, I took a taxi to reach my hotel for the first night - Hotel Shreesh near Link Road. The hotel provided a comfortable stay after the long journey. In the evening, I visited the beautiful **Corbyn's Cove Beach** in Port Blair to spend some time beside the sea and get a feel of the lovely atmosphere in Andaman.

### Exploring the Islands near Port Blair
The next day, I embarked on a journey to some islands near Port Blair. First, we visited [Wiper Island](https://elviaje.github.io/tabs/categories/) but there was nothing much to see there. Then we went to **North Bay Island** where I enjoyed the memorable experience of snorkeling in the clear waters. I also took a ride on a dolphin boat but it was not very exciting. The snorkeling allowed me to witness the vibrant marine life up close and was one of the highlights of my trip. We also planned to visit the historic **Ross Island** but it was cancelled due to the visit of an important personality. Overall, the islands around Port Blair offered scenic beauty and glimpses of nature.
### Journey to the Paradise of Havelock Island 
It was time to move to the main tourist destination of Havelock Island. I took a private cruise called Makruzz from Port Blair which reached Havelock in around 2 hours. The comfortable cruise service made the journey enjoyable. In Havelock, I stayed at the **Gold India Beach Resort** located near the scenic beaches. The hotel provided clean and spacious rooms with pleasant sea-facing surroundings. During my stay in Havelock, I explored the magnificent beaches of **Kala Pathar** and **Radha Nagar**. Kala Pathar beach is ideal to witness the mesmerizing sunrise while Radha Nagar beach has stunning sunset views. At Radha Nagar beach, I enjoyed scuba diving and was able to see the vibrant underwater world up close. The experience of scuba diving among the beautiful corals was surely a highlight of my trip to Havelock.  
### Exploring the Pristine Neil Island
It was time to embark on another cruise to **Neil Island**, the lesser explored but naturally beautiful island. I stayed at **CS Empire Hotel** in Neil which offered comfortable accommodation close to the jetty. In Neil Island, I visited the serene beaches of **Laxmanpur**, **Bharatpur** and **Sitapur** enjoying scenic surroundings and clear blue waters. The breathtaking beach and sunset point at Laxmanpur 1 made it a favourite. I also enjoyed thrilling water sports like snorkeling and jet skiing at Bharatpur beach. Neil Island offered pristine nature and memorable experiences away from the crowds. 
### Enjoying the Sites in and around Port Blair
After returning to Port Blair from Neil Island, I took some rest at my hotel. In the evening, I went to **Corbyn Cove Beach** again and enjoyed an exhilarating parasailing session with scenic views of the coast. On the last day, I visited the historic **Cellular Jail** to learn about the valiant freedom fighters imprisoned there during the British rule. The light and sound show brought alive the saddening stories from the past in an impactful way. Overall, Port Blair offered glimpses of natural beauty along with insights into the islands' rich history and culture.
### Fond Memories of Andaman
This one-week trip to Andaman Islands was one of the most memorable vacations for me. I experienced the best of nature through scenic locales, thriving marine life and soothing ambiance across Port Blair, Havelock and Neil Islands. The comfortable cruise services and clean accommodation options made travel between the islands effortless. Though short, my trip gave me lifetime memories and introduced me to the beauty of islands that will always have a special place in my heart. With well-planned itineraries and local guidance, one can fully explore this serene paradise and create treasured experiences and recollections as I did in Andaman.
