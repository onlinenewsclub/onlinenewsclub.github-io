The metro is undoubtedly the easiest and most efficient way to get around Guangzhou. At just ¥2-8 per ride, it's significantly cheaper than taxis. If you'll be in Guangzhou for several days, invest in a [Yangcheng Tong metro card](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-uc608-uba58-uc758-uc815-uce58-uc801-xb7-ubb38-ud654-uc801-xb7-uacbd-uc81c-uc801-uc0c1-ud669/) - it offers substantial discounts after 15 rides. The metro runs frequently until around midnight. Look for announcements in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English to know your stop. Top stops include **Gongyuanqian Station** near ancient mausoleums and **Chen Clan Academy Station** by folk art museums. 
### Buses Go Almost Anywhere  
Buses complement the metro with routes that reach areas outside the subway lines. At a flat ¥2 per ride, buses are the most affordable option. Popular routes include lines 1, 3 and 5 which pass major scenic spots. Don't be intimidated by the many lines - just memorize your destination stop. Buses run until around 11pm daily.

Guangzhou is famous for its delicious cuisine, but restaurant meals can add up. For hearty, affordable Chinese dishes, head to the local favorites near **Jinan University**. Staples like **Saizeriya pizza** and **Yongyu Cantonese dishes** satisfy for under ¥100 per person. School canteens also offer filling Chinese meals for a fraction of typical prices. Grocery shopping at local wet markets keeps cooking costs low too.
### Free Attractions Abound
While entrance fees apply at major museums, Guangzhou offers free cultural experiences everywhere. Wander ancient **Guang Ta Temple** and its scenic gardens. Stroll along the waterfront promenade at **Flowers City Square** for stunning night views of **Canton Tower**. Take in traditional architecture at the sprawling **Canton Merchant's Godowns**. With so many free options, you don't need deep pockets to appreciate Guangzhou's rich heritage.
