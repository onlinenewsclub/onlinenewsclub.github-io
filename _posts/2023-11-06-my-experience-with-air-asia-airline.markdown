### First experience
I flew with Air Asia for the first time from Delhi to Pune in India. The price of the fare was very inexpensive which is why I chose this budget airline. The boarding process and flight itself had no issues. I was able to pre-order food like sandwiches and snacks online while booking my ticket which helped save some money during the flight. **However, you have to pay extra for important seat selections and even basic drinks unless you want a random seat assignment.** The air hostesses were courteous and helpful during the short domestic flight. Overall, it was a low-frills experience but nothing went seriously wrong.

### Issues with delays 
While Air Asia offers great low prices, I found reliability to be an issue on two separate occasions. The first time I booked, the flight got delayed by over 12 hours with incorrect information provided. This forced me to spend extra on a hotel and still end up at the airport early in the morning. A few years later, another five-hour delay happened without proper updates. **Such long unexpected delays can ruin plans and be very frustrating especially with budget airline schedules and connections.** Always factor in ample buffers if relying on Air Asia for an important trip.
### Surprising behaviors 
On an international Air Asia flight from South Korea to the Philippines, I was taken aback by the flight attendants' [unprofessional public displays of affection](https://thetopnews.github.io/say-goodbye-to-drift-controllers-with-hall-effect-joysticks/). While in inexpensive, it did not seem like the most appropriate environment for staff to be grabbing each other and whispering intimately in plain view of passengers. Thankfully the flight itself was smooth but the visible flirting crossed boundaries in my opinion. Other budget airlines maintain clearer professional boundaries.  
### Poor customer service 
My experience with Air Asia customer service has been below average both in person and online. I recall waiting with a visitor at the airport as their flight got inexplicably delayed by over five hours without transparent updates. Having to endure such long uncertain waits is frustrating enough without the added stress of unhelpful staff. Online responses to complaints have also been inadequate at addressing issues seriously. **Budget airlines still need competent customer support to retain loyal patrons.**
### When it may still be worth it
While reliability and customer experience leave much to be desired, Air Asia remains a good low-cost option when price differences are very significant compared to full-service airlines. As long as you have flexibility built into travel plans and understand potential challenges, taking a chance on their low promo fares could still save hundreds of dollars. Just be mentally prepared to spend unplanned time in airports due to their tendency toward erratic delays. Overall, it's a tradeoff between rock-bottom prices and assurance of smooth travel.
### Closing thoughts
Air Asia revolutionized affordable air travel across Asia but reliability, customer service and basic professionalism still need work compared to more seasoned carriers. Major delays and opaque communications can potentially ruin trips. However, if budget is the top priority and one accepts the higher unpredictability, Air Asia may offer great value during special promotions. Just keep realistic expectations and buffers in scheduling to accommodate hiccups they may cause. Overall, it remains hit or miss depending on individual needs and priorities when flying within their network.
