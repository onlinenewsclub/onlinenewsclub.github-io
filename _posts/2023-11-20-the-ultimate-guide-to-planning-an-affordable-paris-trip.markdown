## Travel by Train
One of the best ways to experience traveling to Paris is by taking the overnight train. Not only does this save you the hassle and cost of finding accommodation for the first night, but you also get to see beautiful scenery from the comfort of your berth or seat as you pass through the French countryside and Alps. Make the most of the journey by dozing, eating in the dining car, or chatting with your travel companions. 
### Make the Most of Your Train Journey
Alternatively, if an overnight train isn't possible, opt for a **high-speed train** like the TGV. These trains are fast so you'll arrive in Paris in no time, plus you can enjoy stunning mountain and lake views passing by your window. Even if you only have a short train journey, use the time to rest your eyes or start planning your itinerary for the big city.

## Book Affordable Accommodation Near Key Points of Interest
One of the best areas to stay on a budget in Paris is around the [Gare du Nord train station](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-08-le-grand-voyage-routier-entre-abu-dhabi-et-doha/). While not the prettiest neighbourhood, it's very well connected and centrally located near major attractions. Another affordable option is youth hostels under the MIGE network, located in the charming Marais district just outside the historic city center. MIGE hostels offer basic but clean rooms and are perfect for solo travelers on a budget. Just be prepared to pay extra for their subpar breakfast. 
### Opt for a Mansard Flat Near Public Transport 
For more independence, search sites like Airbnb for small studio flats known as **mansard rooms**. Often found in 5-story walk-up buildings, they tend to be very affordable at $30-50 per night. Look for ones near metro stations in safe neighbourhoods to easily get around. Just be aware that many lack full kitchens, only having a microwave. Book well in advance for Mansard rooms in prime locations to score a great deal.
## Explore Paris by Metro, Bus and Foot
While the metro is efficient, don't discount city buses as a way to tour Paris. Buses can be surprisingly speedy and offer fabulous views of the iconic architecture lining their routes. Much of central Paris is also very walkable, allowing you to stumble upon charming neighbourhoods and squares along the way. For families with kids, mix transport modes to avoid metro station stairs when possible. Regardless of how you get around, leave time to simply get lost wandering the delightful streets of Paris.
###  Make the Most of Your Time Sightseeing 
With only two weeks, prioritize seeing top attractions like the **Louvre** and **Musee D'Orsay** that require advance planning. Skip long ticket lines by purchasing admission at information centers far from the museums. Stretch your sightseeing budget by taking the stairs up the **Eiffel Tower** instead of the lift, and spend the whole morning exploring all three levels, including winter ice skating.
## Enjoy Free Culture and Stunning Views  
No trip to Paris is complete without soaking in breathtaking views of the City of Light. Research free attractions like rooftop terraces at **Hotel Printemps** for photo ops of iconic landmarks. Spend lazy afternoons in parks like the Jardin du Luxembourg, or immerse yourself in a changing free exhibition at museums each first Sunday of the month. Best of all, simply wander the wending streets while keeping an eye out for panoramic vistas around each new corner.   
### Make the Most of Your Navigo Travel Card
Save money on transport by buying a weekly **Navigo travel card** upon arrival at the airport metro station. Costing just €23 plus a €5 refundable deposit, it permits unlimited trips on the metro, buses, trams and suburban trains in Paris and beyond. Use the pass to visit chateaus like **Versailles** just outside the city limits. Check zones carefully when venturing further out to avoid surprise fines from ticket inspectors.
## Indulge in French Cuisine and Culture
No trip to Paris is complete without sampling the world-class gastronomy and local culture. Spend afternoons relaxing over coffees, croissants and people watching at classic cafés. Break for lunch at boulangeries offering delicious sandwiches, quiches and pastries still warm from the oven. In the evening, venture down side streets seeking the perfect bistro with a lively ambience and affordable prix fixe menus. 
### Experience Paris Like a Local
To truly live like Parisians, visit open air markets on selected days of the week. Browse stalls heaping with just-picked produce, artisanal cheeses and charcuterie. As evening falls, join the soirée by wandering cobbled lanes flickering with cafe lights. Linger over an aperitif or two, taking in life’s simple pleasures. Back at your accommodation, enjoy local favorites you picked up at the market for a romantic dinner in your Mansard room with a bottle of French wine.
## Wind Down with Riverfront Strolls and Panoramic Views  
After many days of cultural immersion, recharge by strolling the scenic riverfront promenades along the Seine. Breathe in cool riverside breezes and watch the sun's hues dance on rippling currents. As daylight fades, watch the awakening of the City of Light from panoramic viewpoints. Cozy cafes perched on the hillsides of iconic **Montmartre** offer postcard-perfect sunsets framed by the glow of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame's soaring silhouette. Savor every magical moment of your affordable Paris adventure amid the charming streets where dreams are born.
### Plan Your Next European Getaway 
No doubt Paris has whet your appetite for more European exploration on a budget. With just a Navigo travel pass, day trips become effortless to charming villages like **Versailles, Chartres** and **Giverny**. Consider adding a multi-city railway pass for further adventures by high-speed TGV. From the iconic cafes of Paris to winding medieval alleys of neighboring cities, you'll create unforgettable memories while stretching your travel funds. Start planning your next affordable European cultural immersion today!
