### Direct Flights or Multi-City Connections?
One option for travelling between Toronto and Chicago is to take direct flights operated by airlines such as Porter Airlines. Flying directly eliminates the hassle of connections but usually comes at a higher price, especially last-minute bookings. As the input mentions, Porter flights from downtown Toronto to Chicago Midway can be very expensive on some days. 
An alternative is to consider multi-city flight itineraries with a stop in Detroit. While this involves making a connection, total airfare may end up cheaper. However, timing is critical to ensure smooth transfers between flights. Layovers of only 25 minutes carry risks of missing connections due to flight delays. Arrange early morning flights to have time to clear **U.S. customs and immigration** at Toronto Pearson Airport before proceeding to Detroit and Chicago.

### Taking the Train via Windsor and Detroit
For those seeking a more [environmentally sustainable travel option](https://thetopnews.github.io/are-most-playstation-giveaways-just-scams-an-in-depth-investigation/), taking the train can be a worthwhile choice. The input outlines one feasible itinerary combining Via Rail and local transit systems. Some key points:
- Take the noon train from Toronto to Windsor station 
- Ride the Windsor city bus to downtown for the international bus to Detroit
- Spend the night in Dearborn before catching an early Amtrak train to Chicago
This multi-modal itinerary allows experiencing the scenic ride on Via Rail. Customs clearance happens smoothly on the international bus. The potential downside is an overnight stay increases travel time versus direct flights. Careful coordination is needed between train and bus schedules too.
### Challenges with Direct Passenger Rail Service  
Establishing direct passenger rail service between Toronto and Chicago faces infrastructure obstacles. As mentioned, existing tracks do not allow direct connections between key rail stations in Detroit and Windsor. Implementing such connectivity would require complex rail switching maneuvers.
Previous direct Toronto-Chicago rail routes operated by Amtrak and Via Rail in the 1970s used the Sarnia, Ontario border crossing farther north. Reviving service on this alignment could bypass Detroit-Windsor constraints but would lengthen journey times versus more southerly routes. Significant capital investments would still be involved to upgrade cross-border infrastructure for high-speed rail.
### Other Multi-city Ground Transport Options
For a surface travel experience without overnight stays, creative multi-city transport combinations are possible. One is:
- Take the afternoon Toronto-Windsor train 
- Ride the Windsor bus downtown and cross to Detroit on the international bus
- Connect to the 6 PM Megabus departure for Chicago, arriving late evening
Total travel time of 9-10 hours keeps it a long but viable one-day option. Luggage transfers require extra coordination. Consider this as a cheaper multi-city alternative if direct or overnight rail/flight options don't fit needs or budget.
### Weighing Up Time, Cost and Sustainability Factors
In summary, there is no single best way to travel between Canada's largest city and a major Midwestern U.S. hub like Chicago. Key variables to balance include time, affordability, environmental impact and personal preferences around modes of transport. 
Direct flights provide convenience but higher cost and emissions. Train travel has lower carbon footprint but longer durations depending on route. Creative multi-city ground options exist with transfers, potentially less expensive than air travel. The optimal option depends on weighing up these different factors based on individual trip circumstances and priorities. Advance planning is important regardless of the routing chosen.
### A Memorable Meal at Lou Mitchell's Along the Way
As an amusing aside, the input references a fortuitous dining experience while traveling from Toronto to Chicago by train. After missing breakfast due to a long layover in Detroit, the travelers were able to enjoy steak sandwiches in Omaha provided by an understanding Amtrak dining crew. 
This reinforces that memorable moments often arise unexpectedly during journeys. Even trips encountering initial delays or frustrations can end up well if one retains flexibility and a sense of adventure. A meal at the iconic Lou Mitchell's diner in Chicago served as a satisfying conclusion to the travelers' cross-border rail odyssey. Their story reflects the small pleasures that can transcend any transportation challenges along the way.
