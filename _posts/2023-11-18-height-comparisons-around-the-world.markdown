### Tall Populations
According to tall.life, 1 in 987 people in China are taller than 190 cm, with an estimated population of 1.371 billion, roughly 1.389 million people tower over 190 cm. In contrast, 1 in 9 people in the Netherlands meet this height threshold, numbering 1.88 million of their 16.94 million population. **While historically renowned as one of Europe's tallest nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently surpassed the Netherlands in average male height.**

### Continued Growth in Somalia
Those with Somali ancestry frequently exhibit great height, as their origins can be traced to the ancient Macrobians, one of the tallest peoples of the ancient world. One Somali man noted he stands at 1.89 meters barefoot and believes he has yet to stop growing, attributing his frame to his genetic heritage. The additional uninhibited growing potential among Somali men could see heights climb even higher in the future.
### Strong Genetic Potential 
Standing populations in the Netherlands remain quite lofty, with average heights hovering around 1.81 to 1.85 meters for men. Moreover, it's common to encounter individuals topping 1.90 meters, though some within this select population feel they're on the shorter side relative to even taller compatriots. Daily interactions routinely expose Dutch men to counterparts measuring 1.93 meters or more. Genetics have cultivated a population uniquely predisposed to maximizing full height potential.
### Towering Prevalence Among Dutch Men
While immenseframes over 1.90 meters may seem extraordinary elsewhere, they're rather ordinary in the Netherlands. Men of this statuette account for 20% of the Dutch male population according to growth surveys. Comparatively, fewer than 1% of Dutch women stretch beyond 1.90 meters. An evident sexual dimorphism emerges with men overwhelmingly represented in the Netherlands' highest height brackets.
### Globalization Mitigates Geographic Discrepancies
As globalization has connected populations in recent decades, intermingling of genetics from around the world is gradually mitigating some past geographic discrepancies in average heights. Nevertheless, pockets maintaining exceptional stature still endure, like Bosnia and Herzegovina surpassing even the historically lofty Dutch. Continued migrations may one day dissolve most extremely divergent height averages between regions. But legacies of ancestry from groups such as the ancient Macrobians apparently endowed Somalis with genetic predispositions favoring remarkable height even today.
### Height Heritability Remains Strong
Height demonstrates robust heritability, with around 80% of variations worldwide attributable to genetics. While adequate nutrition allows for full genetic expression, disparities endure between populations due to historical allele frequency fluctuations. Particularly strong genetic influences on height prevail among Dutch men, over 1 in 5 of whom tower above 1.90 meters. Comparable predispositions appear inherent to those of Somali descent tracing back to East Africa's Macrobians. Both populations demonstrate how genetics profoundly shape a trait as conspicuous as height.
### Conclusion
In summary, pronounced height variances endure globally, with the Dutch and Bosnian males claiming title of world's tallest on average in recent times. However, populations like Somalis and the Somali diaspora inhabited by descendants of East Africa's towering Macrobians also exhibit genetic gifts for stature. Areas maintaining exceptional average heights showcase how ancestry shapes expressed phenotypes. As migration and admixture spread genes more uniformly worldwide over generations to come, geographic contrasts may continue leveling off. Nevertheless, certain populations will likely maintain height advantages due to enduring strong ancestral predispositions.
