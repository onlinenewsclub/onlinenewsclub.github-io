Moscow is an incredible city with a rich history and culture, but living there also came with safety concerns, especially as tensions have risen with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In this article, I will share my experience living in Moscow for three years as an American expat and discuss the security issues the city now faces with drone attacks.
### Adjusting to Life in the Capital
I moved to Moscow in 2018 to take a job teaching English. As a white, blonde, middle-aged American woman, I stuck out in the city. However, I found Muscovites to be extremely warm and welcoming to foreigners. My husband speaks Russian fluently, so whenever we asked for [directions in public](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-27-d-xe9couvrez-les-merveilles-des-xeeles-tonga/), locals would go out of their way to ensure we arrived safely at our destination. Street crime was never an issue during my time there. The bigger dangers came from icy sidewalks in the winter and careless drivers, which is common in many large cities.

### Experiencing True Russian Hospitality
One instance really showed the kindness of strangers in Moscow. Months after his wallet was stolen, my husband was recognized on the street by a park worker who had found his wallet, minus the cash, in a trash can and saved it hoping to return it. Acts of simple human decency like this reinforced that crime generally wasn't a major threat. As long as reasonable precautions were taken in crowded areas, a visitor could feel secure exploring the fascinating neighborhoods and sights.
### The Value of Hiring a Local Guide  
Not speaking Russian as a tourist would mean missing out on Moscow's rich cultural experiences. Hiring a guide is invaluable, not just for safety but to gain deeper insight into the history, architecture, and people. A companion who is fluent in both Russian and English can also help navigate the metro, negotiate prices, and intervene if any misunderstandings arise. Their local knowledge and connections are worth the investment to make the most of limited time in such a vast, complicated city.
### The Looming Threat of Drone Attacks  
Now, nearly five years later, the security situation in Moscow has deteriorated due to the conflict in neighboring Ukraine. Since May 2022, drones have targeted the city in 16 reported attacks that the government insists are being remotely piloted from within Russia itself. On several occasions, missiles fired to intercept the drones have caused damage and risks to civilians on the ground. Airports are shut down when drones are sighted to avoid mid-air collisions with passenger planes, mirroring the tragedy of MH17. While alarms aren't routinely used to avoid panic, the threat is very real. No area feels entirely safe from the potential fallout.
### The Government Downplays the Threat
Officially, the Moscow municipal authorities deny that they can accurately track where the drones may be heading before they appear. They insist on not sounding alarms to respect residents' "mental health" and avoid mass disruption. However, some feel this rhetoric downplays the true dangers and lacks transparency about the government's capacity to defend the capital. Repeated explosions in central, densely populated districts raise questions about how "blind" these attacks really are. Meanwhile, Ukrainians live under constant air raid alerts as Russia fires long-range missiles randomly into civilian areas across their country on a far larger scale. For Muscovites, there is no safe haven apart from underground bunkers.
### Coping with an Escalating Security Risk  
Daily life continues as normal on the surface in Moscow despite the drone strikes. However, an undercurrent of anxiety has grown due to the unpredictable threats from the sky that can materialize anywhere at any time. While street crime was negligible in my years living there, the conflict has dramatically elevated risks that were previously unimaginable. Ordinary people face challenges coping with this "new normal" without open communication or reassurance from authorities. The reality is no area or infrastructure is completely secure, and residents feel increasingly vulnerable without effective defensive measures or warning protocols in place. How Moscow and its people adapt to this escalating security crisis will be an ongoing concern.
### Fond Memories of a Complex City  
Overall, I look back fondly on my time as an expatriate discovering Moscow's rich artistic, architectural and cultural heritage. The warmth of everyday Muscovites despite the language barrier reinforced the fundamental human desire for connection. While the invasion has understandably soured political views, I still feel empathy for ordinary Russian people facing uncertainty due to decisions beyond their control. As tensions rise, it is important for those in leadership on all sides to prioritize minimizing civilian harm through open dialogue instead of unilateral actions that escalate dangers for non-combatants.
### In Summary
Moscow remains a vibrant, global city with an undeniable allure. However, living there now carries new safety risks due to escalating geopolitical tensions. While street crime was a minimal threat during my years as a resident, drone attacks have elevated dangers that were unforeseen. How authorities and citizens adapt to this "new normal" of threats from the air will significantly impact both security and quality of life. We can only hope that all sides work diligently through diplomacy to de-escalate conflicts and return stability for those trying to simply go about their daily lives in the shadow of world events beyond their control.
