### Staying Safe During Attacks
Lviv remains a relatively safe place to visit, even with recent attacks. Most residents do not spend prolonged times in bomb shelters unless sirens sound directly overhead. It's advisable to stay indoors behind at least two walls, like in a hallway or bathroom, during attacks. Emergency supplies like flashlights and power banks are useful in case of outages. A local SIM card is also a smart choice, as [wireless network connectivity](https://northtimes.github.io/2024-01-05-u6b74-u53f2-u7684-u306a-u753a-u4e26-u307f-u3092-u4fdd-u3064/) can become unstable if thousands switch to cellular data during blackouts. Be aware of a nightly curfew from midnight to 5am requiring a special permit to be outside.
