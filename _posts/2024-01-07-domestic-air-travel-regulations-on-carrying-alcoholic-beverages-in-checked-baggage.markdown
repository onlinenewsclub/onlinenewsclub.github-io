### # Pack It Right 
Transporting alcohol on domestic flights within India is permitted but there are certain rules and guidelines to follow. Up to 5 liters of alcohol can be brought in sealed bottles or cans [as checked baggage only](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-05-u52a0-u62ff-u5927-u548c-u7f8e-u56fd-u7684-u6587-u5316-u5dee-u5f02/). The alcohol content should be between 24% and 70% by volume. It is crucial that bottles are packed securely to prevent breakage during transit which could damage other luggage. Using bubble wrap or another protective material inside a duffel bag or sturdy suitcase is recommended. Leaking or open containers are prohibited as they pose safety and hygiene issues.

### # Location Matters
While alcohol is allowed nationally as checked baggage, some **restrictions may apply depending on your destination state**. The northeastern state of Gujarat as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir follow a policy of prohibition so no alcohol is permitted for travel there. It is important to verify policies with your airline prior to travel if flying to a "dry" region. For international flights arriving in India, a reasonable amount of alcohol for personal use is generally allowed through customs upon arrival.  
### # Limit Your Liquid Volume 
Domestic security screening regulations ban carrying liquids, gels or aerosols exceeding 100ml in carry-on baggage. Therefore, checking alcohol as luggage is necessary to transport larger volumes legally. The government has set guidelines on reasonable personal quantities as well, currently up to 5 liters of **distilled spirits** between 24-70% alcohol by volume. Exceeding this limit could result in confiscation at security checkpoints. 
### # Check-In is Checked
Alcohol may only travel in checked baggage, never as a carry-on item. This is due to security screening procedures for cabin baggage. Liquids pose a threat if used as explosives so larger volumes require check-in. Items packed in suitcases go through less stringent screening protocols compared to the tray system for carry-ons. Therefore, checked luggage is the only approved method to include alcohol on domestic flights within permissible quantity limits. Confirm policies directly with your specific airline.
### What Can Happen If You Break the Rules 
### # Confiscation is Common
If security screening detects alcohol outside of the regulated quantity or incorrectly stored as carry-on luggage, confiscation is very likely. Officers cannot allow prohibited or questionable items to board the aircraft for safety reasons. Even if just over the limit by a small amount, the entire alcohol supply may be surrendered without compensation. It's best to leave extra room under the limit to avoid unnecessary losses.
### # Fines May Apply in Some Cases  
On rare occasions, travelers attempting to sneak excess alcohol onto flights or failing to properly package containers could face fines from authorities. These penalties vary depending on the oversight body, such as the airport or customs, and quantity involved. Most confiscations involve no further action but organizers may impose fines for blatant or repeat attempts to bypass regulations. It's not worth the risk to one's travel plans or wallet. 
### # Special Restrictions for "Dry Days"
Certain **major public holidays and elections** are designated "dry days" when stricter alcohol controls are enforced by states. No alcohol sales or public consumption is allowed during these specific periods. Flying with alcohol into an affected area on one of these sensitive days may invite closer inspection or special actions by enforcement agencies. It's best to avoid scheduling travel during dry day periods to simplify compliance with changing protocols.
### # Know Before You Go Is Key
With different cultural norms and complex regulations to navigate across India's diverse regions, the safest approach is diligent pre-travel research. Checking directly with your airline and reviewing updated information from regulatory authorities empowers travelers to pack and transport alcohol legally and without surprises. With proper planning and by strictly following quantity limits and packaging requirements, enjoying an alcoholic beverage occasionally during domestic trips need not involve compliance issues.
