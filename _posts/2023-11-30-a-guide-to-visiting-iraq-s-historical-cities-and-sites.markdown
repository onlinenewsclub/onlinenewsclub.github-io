This guide provides information on six of the top destinations in Iraq worth exploring for those interested in its history and heritage.
## Baghdad: Capital City with Signs of a Glorious Past 
As the capital city of Iraq, **Baghdad holds clues to its medieval golden age** as the center of the Islamic world under the Abbasid Caliphate. Notable attractions include Al-Mustansiriya University, one of the oldest educational institutions in the world established in 1233 AD.

Nearby, the National Museum of Iraq houses priceless artifacts from ancient Mesopotamian civilizations like the Assyrians and Sumerians. Despite challenges, Baghdad remains a highlight for those seeking to learn about Iraq’s rich medieval history.
## Erbil: Contemporary Kurdish Capital with Ancient Roots
Northern Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan Region provides a safe destination to discover Erbil’s unique cultural blending of antiquity and modernity. Towering over the city, the **ancient Erbil Citadel offers panoramic views and architectural marvels over 2,600 years old**. Its maze of alleyways and courtyard homes depict traditional Kurdish life.

As the capital since the 6th century BC, Erbil serves as the cultural heart of Kurdish Iraq.
## Mosul: Historical center now rebuilding after conflict  
Mosul suffered greatly from recent conflicts but efforts are rebuilding this important historical city. The iconic leaning minaret and Great Mosque of Al-Nuri, dating to the early Islamic period, once dominated the skyline. Though damaged, restoration work aims to revive Mosul's architectural heritage. Other notable sites include historic Al-Masfi Mosque and the Mosul Museum displaying artifacts from ancient Assyrian civilization. As Iraq's second largest city, Mosul played a prominent economic and military role over centuries as a crossroads of civilization. Its resilience and cultural richness are evident amid reconstruction.
