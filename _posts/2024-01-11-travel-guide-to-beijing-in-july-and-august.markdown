Beijing, the capital city of China, is known for its rich history and culture. However, visiting Beijing in the summer months of July and August also requires some careful planning to brace the hot and humid weather. This multi-part guide will help travelers navigate their time in Beijing during the peak summer season.
### Preparing for the Heat
While July and August mark the height of summer in Beijing, bringing daytime highs of over 30째C or 86째F, nighttime temperatures only offer slight relief dropping to around 25째C or 77째F. The high temperatures are accompanied by oppressive humidity levels averaging around 65-75%. Visitors need to be fully prepared with lightweight moisture-wicking clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses and sunscreen of at least SPF 30. It is equally important to stay well-hydrated by drinking ample water even if not feeling thirsty.

### Cool Indoor Activities 
On extremely hot days, consider indoor activities to escape the heat. The [Forbidden City](https://northtimes.github.io/2024-01-11-u30cf-u30a4-u30c1-u306e-u4eba-u3005/) located at the heart of Beijing once housed Chinese emperors with extraordinary architecture and artifacts worth spending hours exploring indoors. Nearby, the **National Museum** has a fabulous collection of Chinese artifacts, paintings and sculptures spanning several dynasties under comfortable air conditioning. Other **museums** like the Military Museum, Railway Museum and Space Museum provide educational yet cool indoor activities.
### Evening Activities to Consider
As daytime temperatures ease off in the evenings, outdoor activities become more pleasant. Consider visiting iconic sites like the **Great Wall** or **Summer Palace** in the late afternoon or evening to avoid midday heat. Catching the Symphony of Lights laser show at the **Water Cube** or taking a relaxing boat ride on the **Shicha Lakes** after sunset makes for good evening plans. Stargazing at the **Jingshan Park** hill overlooking the Forbidden City offers beautiful night views of the city skyline free from light pollution.
### Must-Try Cuisine 
Beijing is renowned for its cuisine and summer is a perfect time to sample popular dishes. The light yet flavorful **Peking Duck** is a must-try even if hassle-free hotel restaurants serve versions just as tasty as the famous Quanjude restaurant. Other popular dishes include **Dumplings** available at restaurants or market stalls throughout the city. Refreshing fruits and cold **Bingsoo** or shaved ice desserts offer cooling relief from the heat. Hydrating soups with ingredients like Cordyceps also aid in keeping the body cool internally.  
### Experiencing Rainy Days
Despite the heat, July and August also see frequent rainfall in Beijing due to the plum rains. Umbrellas and lightweight rain gear are advisable for sightseeing on rainy days. Popular attractions with outdoor structures may remain closed on heavy downpours but indoor sites like museums or shopping malls provide sheltered activities. The gleaming **Wangfujing** and **Nanluoguxiang** shopping streets offer unique buys protected from the rain. Alternatively, enjoying a hotpot meal while listening to the soothing pitter-patter of rain outside makes for a cozy indoor activity.
### Getting Around the City
Public transportation forms the mainstay of navigating sprawling Beijing during summer. The clean and efficient subway lines connect most parts of the city with an extensive network of over 20 lines. Buses and taxis also ply the streets though traffic may increase during rainfall. Bicycles, though requiring stamina in the heat, provide a locally authentic way of exploring adjoining hutongs and parks at a leisurely pace. Ride-hailing services like Didi also operate across the capital for point-to-point transfers. Pedestrian friendly areas around Wangfujing and Qianmen combine sights seamlessly with shopping and dining.
### Staying Safe and Healthy 
Visitors must recognize the risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke in such weather, particularly taking part in physically strenuous activities or sports. It is best to plan for adequate rest between outings in air-conditioned places. Use sun protection diligently, remain hydrated by drinking water at regular intervals even without feeling thirsty and seek medical help immediately if experiencing dizziness, nausea or confusion. Following basic precautions will help travelers enjoy their exploration of this vibrant city fully even through the sweltering summer months.
I hope this multi-part guide gives visitors to Beijing in July and August a good sense of navigating the heat while experiencing the best of what the city has to offer through considered planning and adaptations to the weather conditions. Let me know if any other details would be helpful in planning your summer trip to this incredible capital city of China.
