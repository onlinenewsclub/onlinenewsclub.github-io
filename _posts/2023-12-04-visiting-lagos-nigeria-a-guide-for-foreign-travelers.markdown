## Safety and Security Tips When Traveling to Lagos  
Lagos, like many large cities, has its fair share of risks. However, with some basic precautions, visitors can feel safe exploring all that this dynamic city has to offer. Here are some tips for staying secure during your trip to Lagos:
### Research Your Accommodations  
When choosing where to stay, opt for **high-end hotels and resorts located in affluent neighborhoods** like Victoria Island, Ikoyi, and Lekki. These areas tend to have 24/7 security and are far less likely to experience violent crime compared to other parts of the city. Ask the hotel about their security procedures and policies to ensure you'll be protected.

### Arrange Transportation with a Reputable Company
Rather than taking random taxis or buses around the city, **pre-arrange transportation with a professional car service or tour company**. These operators are familiar with the safest routes and can advise on avoiding potentially risky areas, especially at night. Have the driver's contact info on hand in case you need assistance.
### Be Cautious of New Acquaintances  
While Nigerians are often very friendly and welcoming towards foreigners, use caution about new people you encounter, especially those who immediately want to strike up a long conversation or do business with you. Be wary of potential scams and don't feel pressured to hand over money or valuables. Trust your instincts and gracefully excuse yourself if needed.
### Leave Valuables Securely Stored
Flashy displays of wealth, like designer clothes, expensive phones or cameras, attract unwanted attention. **Keep valuable items back at your lodging when exploring the city.** Only carry essential ID, cash and cards needed for the day. This reduces risks of theft or robbery.
### Avoid Isolated Areas at Night  
Lagos is generally safe during daylight hours but [certain streets become unsafe after dark](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-26-s-xe9curit-xe9-et-mode-de-vie-xe0-la-barbade/), so plan activities to wrap up before evening. Stick to well-lit, busy streets and avoid deserted areas, especially on foot, when the night falls. Use pre-arranged transportation for returns to your accommodation.
### Report Any Issues to Police Immediately
While the police response may sometimes be slow, **filing a report is still important** as it establishes a record in case of escalation and could aid in recovering stolen property. Lodge reports for crimes like assaults, thefts or scams attempted against you to the authorities as soon as possible for documentation.
