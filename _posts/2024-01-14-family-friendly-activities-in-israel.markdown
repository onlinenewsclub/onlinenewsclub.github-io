### Kid-Friendly Beaches and Parks
Israel's beaches and amusement parks offer activities for children of all ages. Some of the top beaches for families include Tel Aviv beach along the Mediterranean coast, perfect for building sandcastles. Eilat's beaches on the Red Sea are also excellent for swimming and water sports. Be sure to bring swim toys, buckets, and toys to keep the little ones entertained. 
Luna Park in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan Park in Ramat Gan are **two of Israel's largest amusement parks**, loaded with rides like carousels, bumper cars, and miniature roller coasters perfect for younger kids. Older kids will enjoy more adventurous rides at amusement parks across Israel. Most parks have height restrictions, so check individual ride requirements.
