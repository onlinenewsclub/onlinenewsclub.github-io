Walking around for small distances in Pune is a great option to save money on transportation. For longer distances, taking Pune's public transportation like buses is very affordable. Renting a second-hand bike or scooter is also a cost-effective choice to commute around the sprawling city. Let's explore some of the top cheap transportation options available in Pune.
### Using Pune's Public Transportation System 
Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) operates an extensive network of city [buses](https://elviaje.github.io/google785a0f122eac1ca8.html) that provide affordable transportation across the city. A single bus ticket costs between Rs. 5 to Rs. 10, making it one of the most **economical public transit options**. PMC buses cater to most major routes, with a frequency of 10-15 minutes during peak hours. The service runs from 5 am to around 11 pm daily. Senior citizens, women and students get discounted fares on PMC buses.

### Opting for Cycle Rickshaws or Autos 
For short distances within a locality or campus, **cycle rickshaws** are a handy alternative. Negotiate the fare upfront, usually Rs. 10-20 for 1-2 km trips. **Auto-rickshaws** are metered taxis ideal for door-to-door trips up to 5 km. Fares start at Rs. 18 for the first 1.5 km and increase by Rs. 12-14 per km after that. Both rickshaws and autos are readily available across the city.
### Renting a Scooter or Bike for Flexibility
Renting a **used scooter or bike** gives you flexibility to commute according to your schedule without depending on bus/auto timings. Many shops in Pune rent out well-maintained vintage and modern scooters/bikes for Rs. 300-500/day or Rs. 7,000-12,000/month. It allows exploring places beyond bus routes. 2WheelR is a popular marketplace to find affordable rental options from trusted owners. Maintain rental agreement, license and insurance copies for safety.
### Investing in a Second-Hand Two-Wheeler
For regular commuting needs, purchasing a reliable **second-hand bike** through online marketplaces proves very cost-effective in the long run. Prices start from Rs. 15,000 for 3-5 year old motorbikes and scooters that still have 2-3 years of road life. 2WheelR offers one of the largest collections from private sellers across Pune, along with fair prices and secure payment options. Inspect bike thoroughly and get RC transferred for a smooth ownership transition.
### Considering Shared Mobility Services 
App-based bike taxis like **Bounce** and **Vogo** allow quick and no-hassle point-to-point commute for an average fare of Rs. 8-12/km. Look for promotional rides capped at Rs. 50-100 to explore these services. App-based auto services like **Rapido** provide doorstep pick up for metered fares and surge-free journeys. These shared mobility options supplement public transit for reliable last-mile connectivity.
### Benefiting from Metro Services (in future) 
Pune Metro rail network is a much awaited **mass transit solution** to ease traffic congestion and provide high-frequency public transportation across the city. The first metro line is expected to be operational by 2023, eventually expanding to 7 lines covering over 300 km. Metro fares will be affordable at Rs. 10-30 for most distances. Integrated ticketing with buses can offer further savings. Once fully functional, metro will transform Pune's mobility landscape for decades to come. 
In summary, Pune offers diverse low-cost transportation choices for citizens and visitors alike. From using public buses to rented bikes and upcoming metro services, there are many convenient options to commute affordably across this vibrant city.
