## An Introduction to Yibin and Some Natural Highlights
Yibin is a prefecture-level city located in southwest Sichuan province. As a local, I wanted to share some of the lesser known natural sights that Yibin has to offer beyond its more famous attractions. Yibin offers visitors stunning natural landscapes across its rural areas.  
### **The Largest Bamboo Sea in China - Yibin Bamboo Sea**
The Yibin Bamboo Sea is an expansive bamboo forest covering over 70,000 acres. With 58 recorded bamboo species, it truly lives up to its name as a "bamboo sea". Visitors can wander trails threading through the emerald bamboo thickets and take in the soothing sounds and fresh oxygen-rich air. Don't miss attractions within like the Emperor Temple or scenic spots like Colorful Waterfall. The bamboo sea is renowned as one of China's most beautiful forests.

Nestled in rural hills 25km from Yibin lies the charming Lizhuang Ancient Town, a well-preserved example of traditional Sichuan architecture and culture.

Nearby Cuiping Mountain located right outside Yibin also invites hikers up through forests to panoramic mountain views. 
### **"Three Bend Mountain" and Its Canyons**   
Further afield, the Three Bend Mountain region 140km north of Yibin features dramatic canyon scenery cut through limestone. Hike winding trails above the roaring Chengjiang River threading through the multi-hued cliffs. Camp amongst the rocky peaks taking in starry skies. The magnificent canyonscapes provide magnificent scenes of nature's power and beauty.

For a genuine cultural immersion, homestays within rural villages give a welcome respite from city life.
