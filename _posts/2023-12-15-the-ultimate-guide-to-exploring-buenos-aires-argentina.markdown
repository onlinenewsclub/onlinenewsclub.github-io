### **Must-See Museums and Cultural Attractions** 
No trip to Buenos Aires is complete without learning about the country's turbulent history. Museo de la Memoria is a sobering look at the atrocities committed under the military dictatorship. While difficult, the exhibits and guided tours help visitors understand Argentina's ongoing struggle for human rights. For a fascinating display of one of the country's most iconic figures, Museo Evita housed in the **Recoleta Cemetery** provides historical context around Evita Perón through artifacts, photos and media displays. Art lovers should reserve time for Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, home to works spanning centuries by both local and international artists.  
### **Iconic Neighborhoods to Wander**
San Telmo is perfect for an aimless Sunday morning stroll. In addition to antique shops and historic buildings, the neighborhood comes alive on weekends when dancers perform tango in the streets and artists and vendors fill the famous **flea market**. For **trendy boutiques, cafes and people watching**, head to Palermo Soho. Wander the bustling pedestrian avenues like Calle Florida and Av. Santa Fe filled with stores, street performers and crowds taking in the energy of the city. Experience iconic sites like the **Casa Rosada** and **Congress Building** along the way.
### **Outdoor Activities and Day Trips**
When you need a break from the hustle of the city, Barrancas de Belgrano offers sweeping views of Buenos Aires from the river. Take the scenic train ride north to the affluent suburb of San Isidro for parks, gardens and artisanal cafes and shops. Foodies shouldn't miss **BRÖDS Burger** for their amazing gourmet burgers and crispy fries. For a full day excursion, head to **Mendoza**, Argentina's wine country located at the base of the Andes. Tour lush vineyards against the backdrop of mountains followed by wine tasting at the many **boutique wineries**.
### **Evenings on the Town**
No visit is complete without experiencing the passion and syncopated rhythms of tango. In addition to street performances in San Telmo, cultural centers and milongas (dance halls) offer classes and opportunities to watch masters of the dance. Catch an evening show at Teatro Colon for spectacular performances, though the music and talent can be hit or miss. Authentic soccer matches offer high energy crowd experiences unlike any other. While tickets can be difficult to purchase, accompanying a knowledgeable local ensures the true atmosphere of cheer, chanting and excitement. 
### **Eating Your Way Through the City**
Foodies will relish the melting pot of cuisines representing Argentina's immigrants. Indulge your tastebuds at the on-site restaurant of **Museo Evita** located in the picturesque Recoleta Cemetery. Sample authentic **empanadas** and **medialunas** from a street cart or bakery like Condor Pass.

For an indulgent dining experience, book a reservation at Elena for gourmet interpretations of traditional dishes and creative cocktails in a stunning restored mansion. 
### **Practical Tips for Your Trip**
Buenos Aires can be an affordable destination, but fluctuations in inflation and currency rates mean exchanging dollars or euros locally provides the best value. Most hotels and apartments have on-site safes, so consider storing your cash and using ATMs sparingly. Download transportation apps like Metrobús and Metro to easily navigate the extensive subway and bus systems. English is widely spoken in tourist areas, but learning a few basic Spanish phrases will take you a long way with locals. Flexibility and going with the flow is key - some of the best experiences come from wandering neighborhoods without a strict agenda. With its European flair, passionate culture and abundance of natural and urban attractions, Buenos Aires offers an unforgettable introduction to Argentina.
