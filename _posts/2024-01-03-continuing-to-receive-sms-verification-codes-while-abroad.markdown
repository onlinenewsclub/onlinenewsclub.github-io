## Receiving OTPs from an Indian Number While in the UAE
It is possible to continue receiving SMS verification codes from your Indian mobile number even when living abroad in countries like the UAE. Many people rely on SMS to validate online transactions or login to their accounts while travelling. One option is to purchase a minimum prepaid recharge pack every 28 days from your Indian provider to keep the SIM card active. 
### Maintaining Account Access
This allows you to stay connected to important SMS-based services for up to a month at a time without interruption. Things like **two-factor authentication**, online banking OTPs, ticket bookings and more often require instantly receiving a code via text. By fulfilling the small monthly recharge, your Indian number remains useable for receiving these verification SMSes while living elsewhere long-term. It provides stability and convenience to maintain access to critical accounts during an international move or extended trip abroad.
