## Route Options and Conditions 
The total distance between Delhi and Patna is approximately 1050-1100 kms. There are a few route options to consider for this journey based on road conditions and personal preferences.

### **Alternate Route via Rewa with Less Traffic**  
For those seeking a more scenic drive with less traffic congestion, an alternate option is:
1. Delhi to Agra  
2. Agra to Gwalior
3. Gwalior to Jhansi  
4. Jhansi to Kalpi
5. Kalpi to Jhansi
6. Jhansi to Kanpur
7. Kanpur to Allahabad  
8. Allahabad to Rewa
9. Rewa to Patna
This adds only 200-300kms but has wider **6-lane roads from Rewa to Allahabad** with lesser traffic compared to the direct NH-28 route.
## Planning your Journey Timings
The direct NH-28 route can be completed in 32 hours with an overnight stop or 20-22 hours with meal breaks. Starting early at 4am allows reaching Patna in time for a late dinner. 
For the longer alternate route, budget 34-38 hours with one night stop for rest and comfort. 
Proper planning of **timings, rest breaks and night halts** is important considering the long-distance and safety aspects of the journey.
## Road Safety Precautions
While the national highways are well-developed overall, stick to main routes and avoid detours suggested by GPS. Move at a safe speed obeying traffic rules. Some key safety tips include:
- Taking adequate rest at regular intervals of 3-4 hours of driving  
- Avoiding **night driving** in remote sections without proper lighting
- Checking vehicle condition before starting and carrying essential spare parts
