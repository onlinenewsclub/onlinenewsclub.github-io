### [Nature and Resorts in Hainan](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-09-ubc14-ubca0-uc774-ub3c4-uc2a4-uc5d0-uc11c-uc758-uc0b6/)
Hainan Island is often referred to as the "Hawaii of China" due to its tropical climate and natural scenery. Over the past two decades, numerous local and international resorts have been built across the island to capitalize on its beaches and climate. The city of Sanya on the southern coast in particular has established itself as a popular tourist destination, frequently hosting global beauty pageants such as Miss World. Visitors to Hainan can expect to spend their time relaxing in the sun, swimming in the ocean, and enjoying resort amenities rather than exploring cultural attractions. While there is some history to uncover on the island, most tourists come primarily for leisure activities rather than sightseeing. The secluded resort environment and natural beauty make Hainan Island akin to places like Kauai in Hawaii.

### **Blending History and Modernity in Xiamen**
Located on the southeastern coast of mainland China near the border with Taiwan, Xiamen Island offers a different experience than Hainan despite also being known for its beaches and summer weather. As an island within Fujian Province, Xiamen retains cultural influences from the nearby region and also Taiwan across the strait. Visitors can explore remnants of the city's past as a historic harbor town dating back centuries. Meanwhile, modern architecture like the huge Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition Center symbolize Xiamen's current status as a center of business and education. With its bustling urban environment and mix of old and new, Xiamen provides more historical and cultural context than the resort areas of Hainan.
### **Traversing China from Xiamen or Hainan** 
For international visitors coming to China specifically to visit Hainan or Xiamen, it's important to consider logistics for traveling between the two island destinations or to other parts of the massive country. Flights from most countries will arrive in one of China's major aviation hubs like Beijing or Shanghai on the mainland. From there, Hainan Island is quite isolated, requiring another flight just to reach the island. Xiamen, on the other hand, lies within Fujian Province on China's southeastern coastline. This proximity to other cities makes multi-destination itineraries incorporating Xiaman much more feasible over a limited trip duration. Tourists should research transportation options and build ample time into their itineraries to fully experience China's diverse regions. Working with a local travel agency can also ensure efficient transportation arrangements between desired destinations.
### **Beyond the Beaches: Exploring History and Culture in Xiamen** 
Beyond its beaches and coastline, Xiamen offers history and culture worth exploring. The old districts and buildings from Xiamen's past as an international trading port are well-preserved. Walking tours through areas like Gulangyu Island reveal european architectural influences from when the city was a colonial concession. Historical sites like the Overseas Chinese Museum tell the story of early Chinese emigrants. Temples, gardens, and museums also showcase traditional Fujian culture and art. Xiamen's lively university atmosphere, ethnic diversity, and natural landscapes add depth beyond just sunbathing. Those interested in learning about China through cultural experiences will find more to engage with compared to the resort environment of Hainan. Combining city touring with beach time makes Xiamen a well-rounded destination.
### **Secluded Nature and Luxury on Hainan Island**
While lacking the historical depth of Xiamen, Hainan attracts a different type of visitor primarily seeking rest and relaxation. The tropical climate and unspoiled beaches have shaped Hainan's identity as an island escape for tourists from colder climates as well as domestic Chinese travelers. Secluded resorts dotting the coastline from Sanya in the south to Haikou in the north specialize in providing natural scenery, water sports, and top-tier amenities. Visitors can spend days lounging privately on powder-soft beaches, dining at international buffets, or partaking in activities from golfing to scuba diving. Those prioritizing an unhurried tropical vacation in luxury accommodations will find an idyllic setting in Hainan compared to crowded Xiamen. For simply enjoying the amenities of high-end resorts in seclusion, Hainan is difficult to beat.
### **Tourism Infrastructure in Hainan and Xiamen Today**
Both Hainan Island and Xiamen have matured tremendously in terms of tourism infrastructure over the past two decades. New hotels, restaurants, attractions, and transportation links have dramatically improved the visitor experience. In Hainan, international brands now dominate the resort strips of Sanya. Meanwhile Xiamen boasts modern attractions like Gulangyu Cable Car and Lujiang Pedestrian Street. International flights into Sanya and Xiamen mean both destinations are easily accessible globally. Hainan especially has amplified its branding as a beach paradise through hosting events. Both remain highly competitive tourist hubs with continued investment and development ensuring Hainan and Xiamen stay relevant for international travelers. Strategic government support means the positive trajectory is set to continue into the future.
### **Tailoring a Visit to Individual Preferences** 
In summary, Hainan Island and Xiamen each offer uniquely Chinese travel experiences but also cater to different traveler interests and trip goals. Hainan's resort environment prioritizes luxury, seclusion, and tropical activities ideal for relaxation seekers. Alternatively, Xiamen balances historical exploration, urban culture, and natural scenery to provide a well-rounded overview. Factors like trip duration, budget, interests and travel preferences should guide the selection between the two destinations. With advance planning incorporating local tips, enjoying the distinctive qualities of either Hainan or Xiamen promises an enlightening introduction to coastal China. Overall both locations have matured their infrastructure and continue enhancing visitor offerings regularly.
