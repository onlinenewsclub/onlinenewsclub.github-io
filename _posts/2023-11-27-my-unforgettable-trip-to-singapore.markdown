Singapore is renowned worldwide as one of the cleanest, greenest and safest countries in Asia. As someone who hails from Kenya, I was both excited and curious to experience what brought Singapore so much recognition. Here are key highlights from my memorable 8-day trip to this incredible city-state.
### Welcoming Surprises at Changi Airport
Arriving at [Changi Airport](https://vsmarts.github.io/), I was struck by its opulence, with beautiful gardens and attractions in each terminal. After immigration, I made a beeline to the **Jewel Changi Airport** to admire its rainforest locale and lively vibe fueled by free WiFi. A quick **iced coffee** from a nearby stall hit the spot before boarding my Grab to the hotel.

### Efficiency on Display from the Get-go 
Reaching the hotel, I was impressed by how the cab booking app directed me to the pickup point seamlessly. Settling into my room, I charged by phone and took a nap to shake off jetlag. When refreshed, a short stroll led to a **7-Eleven** where a friendly shopkeeper saw to my SIM card needs with ease.
### Soaking in the Scenic Views of Marina Bay 
The next morning, I headed to **Merlion Park** for stunning views of the iconic **Marina Bay Sands** and surrounding skyscrapers. Crossing the bay on foot, I window shopped at top **luxury brands** along the **Gardens by the Bay**. Later, the well-manicured botanical wonder left me in awe of Singapore's "tamed nature".
### Efficient Public Transport Makes Exploration a Breeze
That evening, my first **MRT ride** from Bayfront to Botanic Gardens was seamless on the integrated ticketing system. In subsequent days, I relied on the efficient bus and rail network to reach attractions like **China Town**, **Little India** and **Orchard Road** with minimal fuss. 
### An Island Getaway for Thrill and Tranquility 
A trip to **Sentosa Island** brought **Universal Studios** fun with long queues, but other spots like the **SEA Aquarium** and **Fort Siloso** offered calm respite. I also enjoyed cable car and monorail rides across the mainland. The **Wings of Time** laser show at night was mesmerizing. 
### Bonding with Nature in Unexpected Ways 
At **Jurong Bird Park**, I was delighted by the wide variety and interactions between birds and visitors. The **Cloud Forest** section in **Gardens by the Bay** showed Singapore's mastery over curating nature within the city. These experiences fed my soul meaningfully.
### Fond Memories of a Model Metropolis 
In conclusion, Singapore left me in awe through its well-planned urban infrastructure, green spaces, efficient systems and warm locals. While tuckered out, I savored memories of this inspirational city-state and its successes since independence. No doubt, Singapore deserves its reputation as one of the world's most liveable countries.
