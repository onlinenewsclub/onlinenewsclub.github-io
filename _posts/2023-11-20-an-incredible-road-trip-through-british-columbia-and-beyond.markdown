### Getting Started in Victoria
Taking the ferry from Vancouver Island to the mainland town of Victoria was the perfect starting point for my western Canada adventure. As the largest city on Vancouver Island, Victoria has a distinctly British atmosphere with colonial architecture and picturesque gardens. I was lucky to find the last available room at a quaint downtown hotel near Buchart Gardens. Formerly a gravel pit, these gardens are now beautifully landscaped with illuminated pathways snaking between flowerbeds and water features, providing the perfect evening stroll.

### Through the Canadian Rockies
Heading east on the Trans Canada Highway, the rugged coastal mountains gave way to the [magnificent Canadian Rockies](https://thetopnews.github.io/A-Guide-to-Building-Modern-and-Rustic-Homes-in-Minecraft/). Near Rogers Pass, vast herds of buffalo roamed the grasslands. Lake Louise took my breath away with its cerulean waters edged by towering glaciers. Emerald forests, azure lakes and craggy peaks were around every bend in the road. Over 45 years have passed, yet the majestic landscapes are etched vividly in my memory.
### Cattle Country in Alberta and Manitoba
Continuing across the prairies of Alberta and Manitoba, vast open fields stretched as far as the eye could see. Ranchers tended their cattle on the rolling grasslands. On clear days it felt like you could see forever across the flat, fertile plains covered with wheat, corn and other crops. The wide open scenery was a sharp contrast to the jagged mountain terrain left behind in the Rockies. 
### Experiencing Urban Life in Calgary  
As a growing commercial hub, Calgary successfully blended its cowboy culture with modern amenities. Downtown skyscrapers towered above historic buildings housing bars and restaurants serving up **classic Western cuisine**. Visitors can learn about the region's ranching heritage at venues like the Calgary Stampede exhibition grounds. Despite expanding rapidly, Calgary maintained its small-town charm.
### Majestic Lake Superior
My journey eventually led to Sault Ste. Marie, situated along the northern shore of gorgeous Lake Superior. Known as "Gitche Gumee", this vast freshwater sea's cold, deep waters inspired poetry by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Crossing the mighty Mackinac Bridge, I left Ontario bound for home, winding up an unforgettable few weeks exploring western Canada's stunning natural beauty and vibrant cities.
### Iconic Oregon Coastline 
No trip to the Pacific Northwest would be complete without seeing Oregon's breathtaking coast. Dotted with seaside towns, the scenic Highway 101 showcases glorious ocean vistas around every bend. Impressive bridges showcasing innovative **1930s WPA architecture** span scenic rivers emptying into the sea. Historic lighthouses stand watch over crashing waves. Playful sea lions and frolicking seals inhabit rocky tide pools. Vast forests climb steep hillsides to verdant coastal valleys.
### Experience the Beauty of Olympic National Park
Another must-see destination in the region is Olympic National Park in Washington. Towering rainforest covering the slopes of the Olympic Mountains contains some of the largest remaining stands of primeval temperate rainforest in the continental US. Hike the trails of the mythical **Ho River Rainforest** to spot elusive Roosevelt elk and spotted owls amidst giant Sitka spruce and Western red cedar trees festooned with epiphytic plants. For breathtaking views, drive up to Hurricane Ridge where alpine wildflower meadows are backdrop to glacier-carved peaks and forested valleys below. Nature lovers will be in awe of this verdant wilderness.                
### Architectural Wonders of Portland
Further south, the vibrant city of Portland showcases the region's innovative spirit through stunning signature bridges crossing its many scenic waterways. Wander the manicured International Rose Test Garden bursting with colorful blooms, or peruse over a million used and rare books at independent Powell's City of Books, the largest indie bookstore in the world. For a taste of the city's craft brewing and coffee roasting roots, sample a locally produced artisan beverage. With its blend of natural beauty, hip culture and commitment to sustainability, Portland proves to be one of the most livable cities in the US.  
### California's Redwood Coast 
Continuing down the rugged California coast, Avenue of the Giants stands out, an enchanting backroad flanked on both sides by towering ancient coast redwoods. One of the few remaining original **old-growth redwood forests** left in the state, it's easy to feel small walking among these nature's giants soaring over 300 feet tall. Learn about the region's logging history at nearby Humboldt Redwoods State Park with its majestic Redwood Trail. Further south lies breathtaking Big Sur, sheer seacliffs plunging into pounding surf. This memorable western road trip offered so many incredible highlights to inspire further exploration throughout this gorgeous region.
