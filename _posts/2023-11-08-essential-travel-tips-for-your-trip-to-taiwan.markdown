Taiwan is absolutely one of the best places to visit in Asia. From beautiful scenery to fascinating culture and fantastic food, there's so much to discover on the island. However, it also pays to do some planning and preparation to make sure your trip goes as smoothly as possible. Here are some essential Taiwan travel tips to help you navigate this wonderful destination with ease.
## Getting Around With an EasyCard
As a visitor to Taiwan, one of the most important items to pack is an **EasyCard**. This reloadable stored-value card can be used on trains, metros, buses and for bike rentals across the country. Getting an EasyCard allows you to avoid hassles with currency exchanges and gives you convenient contactless payment for public transport. You can purchase EasyCards at major train stations or metro stations when you first arrive. Be sure to add credit before your trip so you're ready to explore Taiwan's excellent transport network from day one.
## Downloading Translator Apps and Changing Money
Language barriers can sometimes pop up when traveling internationally. To help overcome any communication issues, be sure to download the **Google Translate app with Chinese language support** to your phone before departing. This will let you translate texts on the fly. Also take some **New Taiwan dollars (NTD)** with you from your home country. While major cards are generally accepted, you'll need cash for street food, minor purchases and transport top-ups. It's best to wait until arriving in Taipei or Kaohsiung to purchase a local SIM card for better rates.
## Checking the Weather Before Heading Out
Taiwan experiences very changeable weather patterns, especially on the mountainous east coast. A sunny morning can quickly turn rainy. Always check the **weather forecast for your destination** and pack appropriate clothing like an **umbrella or raincoat**. You'll want layers too as temperatures vary significantly depending on elevation. Being prepared will help you avoid getting caught in the rain or feeling too hot/cold while sightseeing. This is especially important for outdoor attractions and hikes.
## Exploring Night Markets for Authentic Dining
A highlight of any Taiwan trip is indulging in the delicious and affordable street eats available everywhere. Be sure to spend an evening exploring one of Taiwan's famous **night markets**, which offer countless food stalls serving **traditional snacks and main dishes.** Night markets like Shilin, Raohe and Ningxia are vibrant hubs filled with the sounds, smells and flavors of Taiwanese cuisine. Wandering along the alleys, you'll find **plate lunches, skewers, shaved ice desserts and more**. It's the perfect way to experience local culture through your tastebuds.
## Getting Around Taichung With the Metro
The city of **Taichung** lies in central Taiwan and makes an excellent base for exploring surrounding destinations like Rainbow Village, Dalingxi Old Street and Xiaobailong. Within Taichung itself, the efficient metro system is the easiest way to navigate. All you need is your EasyCard to ride lines Green and Orange which run from early morning until late evening. Stations are integrated with major landmarks, so you can easily access top attractions around the city. Download the **Taichung Metro app** to check schedules and find your way around. This makes exploring Taichung a breeze whether you're traveling by yourself or with family.
## Using TRA and HSR Trains Between Major Cities
While buses are an option, trains are often more convenient and comfortable for traveling between Taiwan's biggest cities. The modern **High Speed Rail (HSR)** zips between Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung in just hours, providing stunning coastal views. For a more budget-friendly ride, the regular **Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA)** crosses the entire island on one track. Check schedules and book tickets on their respective websites up to 3 months ahead if traveling during holidays or long weekends. Your EasyCard allows you to quickly access the platforms at major stations as well.
## Braving Misty Alishan by Train 
**Alishan Forest Recreation Area** is renowned for its mystical old-growth forests, mountain ch√¢teaux and breathtaking sunrises visible across a sea of clouds. One of the most scenic ways to reach this high-altitude retreat is via the historic **Alishan Forest Railway**. Winding upwards from Chiayi, this single-track railway offers travelers close-up views of lush rainforests and steep ravines. Keep your cameras ready for photo opportunities at bridges and tunnels. Be sure to book tickets on the Alishan Railway website well in advance, as this journey sells out quickly. Your journey through mist-cloaked mountains will be an highlight of any Taiwan trip.
## Staying Safe With Emergency Numbers Handy
While Taiwan has an extremely low crime rate, it's still wise to take basic safety precautions. Keep emergency contact numbers like **110 for police and 119 for ambulances** programmed into your phone. Consider traveling with company for late night explorations. Also pay attention to weather warnings, as natural disasters do occur. Otherwise, you'll find Taiwanese people to be incredibly warm and welcoming. By exercising common sense precautions and cultural awareness, your Taiwan trip is sure to be safe and hassle-free. Proper planning using the travel tips covered here will let you immerse yourself in this welcoming country with ease.
