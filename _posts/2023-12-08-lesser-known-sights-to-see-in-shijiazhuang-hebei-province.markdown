### Discovering Local Villages
Shijiazhuang is located in Hebei province and has a population of over 10 million people. While it may not top many travel itineraries, the city has a number of lesser known sights worth exploring. One such attraction is the [Village of Stone](https://setit.github.io/2024-01-07-mengapa-austria-tidak-dimasukkan-dalam-persatuan-jerman-tahun-1871/) located in Jingxing county, just outside of Shijiazhuang. This unique village is interesting in that over 90% of residents share the same family name - Yu. Locals believe the villagers are descendants of Yu Qian, a prominent minister from the Ming dynasty. Wandering through the stone pathways and traditional residences offers a glimpse into rural living.

### Exploring Historical Sites 
History buffs will enjoy sites that pay homage to Shijiazhuang's past. **Baoduzhai** is the scenic location where parts of the classic Chinese novel "Dream of Red Mansions" were filmed in the late 1980s. Visitors can tour the picturesque gardens and pavilions used as backdrops in the film. **Zhaoyun Temple** in downtown Shijiazhuang honors the accomplishments of Zhaoyun, a talented scholar from the region during the Han dynasty over 2,000 years ago. The ancient walled city of **Zhengding** located an hours drive west of the city was once a strategically important military site during imperial China.
### Appreciating Rural Landscapes
Nature lovers will find plenty to admire in Shijiazhuang's rural outskirts. In the summer months of July and August, vast patches of golden **wheat fields** transform the landscape. Local farms welcome visitors to leisurely wander through the rows of ripening crops. The **Hutuo River** that winds through the city historically runs dry for much of the year, but its wide pebbled riverbed provides the unique experience of an "ATV safari" across the flat basin. Be sure to visit in spring when seasonal rainfall sometimes fills the river with a rare flow of water.  
### Discovering Contemporary Art and Architecture
A remarkable modern attraction is the sprawling **Xinle Art Academy complex** located a short drive outside the city. Inspired by Hogwarts from the Harry Potter series, the collection of imaginative buildings, gardens and walkways striving to fuse art and nature into a harmonious whole. Inside, coffee shops and art workshops activate the space. On weekends, photographers flock here for elegant pre-wedding photo shoots amidst the scenic backdrops. The whole family can easily spend an enjoyable afternoon exploring this architecturally stunning campus.
### Experiencing Modern Amenities

With the 2022 Winter Olympics in nearby Beijing raising Hebei's profile, investments continue to transform Shijiazhuang into a livable metropolis.
