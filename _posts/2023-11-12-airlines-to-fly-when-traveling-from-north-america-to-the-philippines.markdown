## Choosing an Airline
When traveling from North America to the Philippines, there are several airline options to consider. Factors like flight duration, connecting airport locations, and onboard experience all play a role in deciding which airline provides the best value. Based on multiple trips from different departure cities, here are some recommendations on [selecting the most comfortable and convenient airline](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-02-u9ed1-u8272-u68ee-u6797-u4e2d-u7684-u592a-u9633-u2014-u8d6b-u5c14-u66fc-xb7-u9ed1-u585e-u5c0f-u8bf4/) for your Philippines journey.
### Philippine Airlines 
For direct flights from the west coast, **Philippine Airlines is a top choice**. They operate nonstop routes from Vancouver, Los Angeles, and San Francisco straight to Manila. While the flight time of 15-20 hours may seem long, avoiding stopovers helps minimize travel delays and lost time. Philippine Airlines provides consistently **high quality and reliable service** thanks to their extensive experience on this route. The cabin crews are also very friendly and familiar with serving international travelers. Overall, their direct flights make them a great pick for west coast departures seeking simplicity.

### Korean Air or Delta from Chicago
Travelers flying out of Chicago have good options in Korean Air or Delta. Korean Air offers a flight into Clark International Airport in Angeles City, which is about a 2 hour drive north of Manila. From there you'd need a short domestic connecting flight into Manila. **Delta provides non-African service into Manila airport directly**. Both airlines offer comfortable seats and in-flight entertainment to pass the time. Just be aware of the additional travel if flying Korean Air into Clark versus a direct Manila arrival on Delta.
### American Airlines from Dallas
The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport hubs many international flights. **American Airlines operates direct service from DFW to Cebu**, the second largest city in the Philippines. Cebu's airport is generally less crowded and more manageable than busy Manila airport. This makes it a good entry point if also visiting destinations in Southern Philippines later on. American provides a smooth and reliable trip departing the large Dallas airport.
## Additional Considerations 
Beyond the airline, also factor in the airports for your connecting flights. **San Francisco and Vancouver typically have fewer delays or cancellations than LAX.** Coming from the East Coast, consider flying into the West Coast for a Philippine Airlines nonstop rather than multiple connections. **Korean Air can involve a long drive from Clark to Manila after landing.** Lastly, opt for business class if possible for **extra legroom and amenities** on long-haul international flights. Staying comfortable makes all the difference over 15+ hours in the air.
### Avoiding Layovers in China 
Some carriers like China Southern offer connecting flights through cities like Guangzhou but multiple people reported issues **with long immigration delays upon arrival in China**. Even with a boarding pass to the Philippines, it can take hours to clear Chinese customs. Unless timing permits extra layover time built in, it's best to avoid routing through the mainland. Stick to transits in friendlier Asian countries like Korea, Japan or Southeast Asian hubs instead.
### Considering Flight Classes
When it comes to flight class, economy will get you there affordably but consider upgrading for Asia-Pacific routes if possible. **Business class seats fully recline, offer wider seating, and include meals** making very long flights much more bearable. Premium cabins also include access to airline lounges where you can grab snacks/drinks and WiFi before boarding. The comfort is worth it for those capable of spending a bit more. Otherwise economy gets the job done, just pack entertainment and snacks!
## Final Recommendations
In summary, for direct flights to Manila **Philippine Airlines from the West Coast** is hard to beat. From Chicago, **Delta offers nonstop service** while **Korean Air provides an option into Clark**. Travelers from Dallas are well served by **American Airlines to Cebu**. Factors like airline experience, convenient airports, and onboard amenities affect the travel experience greatly. Focusing on those will lead you to the right choice of air carrier when discovering the beautiful Philippines.
