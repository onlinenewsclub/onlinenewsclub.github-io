### Day 1: Sights Around Manhattan
Manhattan is the center of New York City and packed with iconic sights, culture, food and attractions. Start your first morning in NYC with a classic bagel from Essa-Bagel in the Lower East Side. Then head to the [United Nations Headquarters](https://elviaje.github.io/_tabs/categories/) for a free tour to learn about the global organization. Spend the afternoon relaxing in Central Park by renting a rowboat on the lake. In the evening, check the TKTS booth in Times Square for cheap last-minute Broadway tickets. Enjoy a pre-show dinner on Restaurant Row before your play.

### Exploring Central Parks and Neighborhoods   
Central Park is the lungs of Manhattan - spend your second day exploring it. Start with breakfast at the dog-friendly Barking Dog Cafe, then visit the Carl Schurz dog run. Walk along Strawberry Fields and stop for a slice of pie at popular Cafe Lalo. Next, stroll the High Line elevated park for views of the city. Have pizza for lunch from legendary Artichoke Basils. Browse Chelsea Market and sip coffee at 9th Street Espresso. Wander through the East Village for drinking and live music at spots like Good Beer and Rue B. End your night at the **Nuyorican Poets Cafe** for its poetry slam.
### Top Sites in Lower Manhattan
The third day focuses on downtown attractions. Grab a bagel from **H&H Bagels** then visit Battery Park and take the free Staten Island Ferry. See the financial district on Wall Street before exploring **Chinatown**'s diversity for lunch. Stroll Little Italy and indulge in cannoli at Cafe Palermo. Catch an indie film at Angelika Film Center in SoHo. Finally, unwind in Washington Square Park.  
### Exploring Beyond Manhattan
Make your way to Brooklyn on day four. Walk across the iconic Brooklyn Bridge in the morning. Enjoy brunch in the neighborhood of Park Slope. Check out unique films at the **Museum of the Moving Image**. Have iconic Di Fara Pizza for lunch in Midwood. Spend the afternoon exploring the artsy bars, shops and music venues of Williamsburg. Finally, play retro games at the fun Barcade venue.
### NYC Subway tip: Avoid Empty Cars
During hot summer days in New York, avoid getting on near-empty subway cars, even if they seem appealing for the air conditioning. Unfortunately, these cars sometimes have malfunctioning ventilation, unwanted odors, or clean-up issues. Instead, opt for a packed car where you know the AC is working properly. Stay cool and comfortable during your travels in the busy transit system.
