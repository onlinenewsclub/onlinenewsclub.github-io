### Coast or Inland? 
With two main options available - coastal or inland - let's analyze the pros and cons of each route. The [coastal route](https://travelokie.github.io/2024-01-03-why-you-need-an-nvme-heatsink-a-guide-to-keeping-your-high-performance-ssd-cool/) offers beautiful ocean scenery and more opportunities to stop along the way but is **longer in distance and prone to traffic, especially around Sydney**. Meanwhile, the **inland route** cuts down on travel time but risks the scenery becoming **boring with long stretches between fuel stops**.

### A Mix of Both Coast and Inland 
A compromise is to take a mixed route, balancing scenic locations with efficient driving. We'll start in Brisbane and head to Coffs Harbour for its stunning coast before turning inland via the **scenic Waterfall Way** to Armidale and Tamworth. Continuing further inland allows us to explore the **wine country around Muswellbrook** instead of the flat lands past Dubbo. 
### Picturesque Drives Through National Parks
Leaving Muswellbrook, the next day's drive takes us through the **Goulburn River National Park** on our way to historic Bathurst. We'll stop to drive around the famous **Mount Panorama Circuit** and continue through quiet country roads to Cowra and Albury. Crossing into Victoria, it's a straightforward motorway ride into Melbourne. Total distance is just under 1900km over two days.
### Alternative Inland Route
For those seeking maximum efficiency with minimal stops, the direct inland Hume Highway route is best. Starting from Melbourne, travel through Seymour and then follow the Goulburn Valley Freeway north. Spend the night in **Dubbo** before continuing on A39 up through NSW to the Queensland border. Total around 1500km in less than 24 hours. 
### Tips for a Safe and Enjoyable Trip
No matter the chosen route, here are some tips to help your journey go smoothly:
- Check timetables to avoid peak traffic periods in major cities.  
- Finish driving before dusk to minimise wildlife collision risks.
- Take snacks, water and some cash in case regional fuel stops lack card facilities.
- Stop every two hours to reduce driver fatigue.
- Look out for **fuel levels** on all-day stretches between service stations.
- Have an idea of upcoming towns in case you need to stop earlier than planned.
With careful planning using the guidance above, you can efficiently navigate between Brisbane and Melbourne while still enjoying scenic stops along parts of the iconic Australian coastline.
### Variations that Add Interest  
While the inland route is quickest, consider tacking on optional coastal sections to break up the scenery. 
Leaving Melbourne on the Hume Highway, you could branch off at Euroa for a detour via **Nagambie Lakes** before reconnecting at Shepparton. Another alternative is turning off the Goulburn Valley Freeway at Numurkah to drive the coast from **Lakes Entrance** back to the Princes Highway south of Bairnsdale. 
North of Dubbo, instead of continuing straight on A39, take the longer **Waterfall Way** from Armidale down to the coast at Coffs Harbour like we outlined earlier in reverse. Rejoin the inland route past Tamworth.
Small diversions like this make the journey more scenic and interesting without significantly extending the overall travel time compared to the pure inland option. Paying attention to higher fuel consumption in hilly coastal areas is important with the added distances involved.
### Safety First for a Relaxing Trip  
As a final reminder, prioritise safety over rushed driving to fully relax and enjoy the open road. Fatigue is a serious risk on long haul trips, so take regular breaks as recommended and avoid pushing through to destinations if tiredness hits early. Also watch wildlife, livestock and changing light/weather conditions especially around dusk in rural areas. Applying common sense will help your Brisbane to Melbourne drive be a pleasure all the way.
