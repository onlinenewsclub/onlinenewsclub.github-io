North of Lehigh Ave should also be avoided for several miles, but it does become safer further north. Ask your hotel concierge or do some research online about which specific neighborhoods to avoid visiting at night for safety concerns. Public transportation is highly recommended over driving, as it is more affordable and parking is expensive and tricky to navigate. You'll also want to be cautious visiting some parts of far West Philly and scattered areas in South Philly.
