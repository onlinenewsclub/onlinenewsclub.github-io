If you're traveling to Bangkok with family, hotels and resorts are a great option. You'll find thousands available at affordable prices all over the city. However, avoid staying in Patpong and Khao San areas if your parents prefer a more relaxed environment. 
For solo or group trips with friends, hostels are highly recommended. You'll meet other travelers and easily make new connections. Some top choices include **Thrive Hostel Bangkok**, where I stayed and enjoyed my time. Hostels offer a lively social scene and chance to experience Bangkok like a local.

### **Prime Locations for Both Accommodation and Nightlife**

Wander along Patpong soi and experience lively bars, clubs, restaurants and even street shows. It's the perfect base for those wanting to dive right into Bangkok's pulsating nightlife.
Khao San Road also offers plenty of accommodation options within its lively backpacker enclave. Budget hotels and dorm-style rooms let you stay right in the thick of the action. Come evening, Khao San Road transforms into one of Bangkok's best party spots with bars blasting music late into the night. It's an ideal home base for those wanting to socialize and experience Bangkok's cultural hub.
## Sights and Attractions in Bangkok
### **Must-See Temples: Experiencing Traditional Thai Culture**
No trip to Bangkok is complete without visiting some of its iconic temples. Wat Pho houses the **largest reclining Buddha statue** in Thailand at over 150 feet long. Nearby Wat Arun is recognizable from its striking central prang spire situated along the Chao Phraya River. For ornate beauty, Wat Benjamabophit or the Marble Temple stands out with its Italian marble construction.

But the most sacred site is Wat Phra Kaew, home to treasures inside the magnificently decorated Grand Palace complex. Budget time at some of these temples to experience quintessential Thai culture and history.

For a different perspective of Bangkok, take a river cruise along the Chao Phraya River. This allows you to see icons like Wat Arun and majestic riverside hotels and palaces from the water. Hop aboard a traditional long-tail boat or modern cruise liner to relax while admiring the sights float by. Dinner and sunset cruises are especially romantic options to experience the illuminated city after dark. The river also serves as the main transportation artery, giving glimpses into daily local life along its shores.

### **Vegetarian Friendly Food: Oasis for Non-Meat Eaters** 
While meat rules Thai cuisine, Bangkok has a niche for veggie travelers. Cabbages and Condoms tops recommendations thanks to its extensive vegetarian page detailing tasty mock meats. Ask servers for ideas to mimic flavors without animal ingredients. Japanese places let you build your own bowl with rice, veggies and proteins like bean curd or eggs. Certain Thai restaurants oblige special requests like meatless red or green curries.

Those seeking a nicer nightcap can find respite in Bangkok's growing collection of rooftop bars. Most luxury hotels have scenicopen-air loungesperfect for sundowners with the towering city and river views as the backdrop. Sip innovative cocktails while chilling to DJ sets or live bands. Top picks like Bamboo Bar, Sky Bar and Distil offer stylish yet relaxed ambiences away from the rough Street party zones below.
