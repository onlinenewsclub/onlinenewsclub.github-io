Netflix allows account owners to create profiles and share their login credentials with family members who live in different homes from the account holder. Here are some key points about sharing a Netflix account across different households:
### Setting Up Profiles for Family Members
Netflix allows up to [five profiles](https://jnewshub.github.io/2024-01-02-travelling-experiences-in-china/) on a single account. Each profile can have its own recommendations, watch history, and settings. The account owner can create profiles for family members who live elsewhere and share their login credentials. For each family member, the owner can customize the profile with their name, photo, and content restrictions as needed.

### Streaming Simultaneously Based on Plan
A notable limitation is the number of simultaneous streams allowed based on the Netflix subscription plan. The basic plan supports **one stream at a time**, while standard and premium plans increase this to two and four streams simultaneously. Account holders need to communicate with family members to avoid exceeding these limits when streaming from different locations.
### Account Usage Across Different Physical Addresses 
Netflix's terms of use state the account can be shared within a household, which can include family members in separate homes. As long as the shared access remains within the household, it follows Netflix's rules. However, sharing credentials outside of the household with friends or others not part of the family violates the terms.
### Location-Based Access Restrictions
In some cases, Netflix may refuse connections or send verification emails if the access locations seem suspicious, like logging in from two very distant places within a short time. This helps identify potentially compromised or shared accounts being used improperly outside the household. As long as usage remains within family households in different locations, access usually works smoothly.
### Coordinating Streaming Around Connection Limits 
For families sharing a Netflix account across homes, it's important the account owner communicates the simultaneous stream limits to family members. They need to coordinate their streaming to avoid exceeding these limits set by their subscription plan. With clear communication and planning viewing schedules together, families can easily share a Netflix account even when located in different physical homes.
### Benefits of Sharing with Household Family Members
By creating profiles and sharing login credentials responsibly within family households, Netflix account owners can extend the benefits of their subscription. Distant family members gain access to enjoy TV shows and movies together remotely. And with profile customizations, each family member's unique preferences are respected. Proper sharing allows families to feel more connected through shared Netflix viewing experiences despite living apart.
### Summary: Rules for Safe Account Sharing
In summary, Netflix is friendly to sharing an account responsibly between household family members living apart, as long as a few important rules are followed. Setting up profiles, staying within streaming limits, and using the account address within family households ensures the sharing follows Netflix's terms of use. With communication and coordination, geographically separated family units can legally and helpfully share in the Netflix streaming experience together.
