### Origins of this Holy Land
Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad, holds great historical and religious significance as one of the oldest cities in India. According to Hindu scriptures, it is the place where Lord Brahma, the creator of the universes, chose to perform a yajna or fire ritual. It is believed to be the site where **drops of Amrit, the elixir of immortality from the Samudra Manthan ceremony fell to earth.** 
Three of India's most important rivers - the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati - **converge at a sacred location known as the "Sangam" in Prayagraj.** Over millennia, this confluence site has attracted millions of pilgrims who bathe in the rivers hoping to attain moksha or salvation. **The Kumbh Mela, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world held every 12 years, is celebrated here** with people from all walks of life coming together.
