Flight booking can be a stressful process, especially when searching for affordable options. After seeing mixed reviews about the flight booking website Happyfare, I decided to take a chance with them and share my experience to help others. Here is my story in the hopes it provides some clarity.
### Comparing prices and taking a risk
I was in need of booking a last minute flight for an upcoming trip but prices on major travel sites were much higher than expected. That's when I came across Happyfare while searching online and noticed they advertised significantly lower fares. However, I also saw some negative reviews questioning the legitimacy of the site. With my flight date approaching and no other affordable options, I decided to take a risk and [save on international last minute flights](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-11-01-comparing-the-unique-cultures-of-sicily-and-sardinia/).

### The booking and confirmation process  
The booking process through Happyfare was straightforward. I entered my travel details and payment information to complete the purchase. Once paid, I received an email confirmation but noticed the booking did not show up on the airline website right away as it does with other sites. This raised some initial red flags based on other reviews. However, Happyfare support assured me this was normal as they batch book flights. They provided details to help address any questions from the airline if needed.
### Checking in and arrival at the airport
As my travel date neared, I grew more anxious not seeing my booking on the airline site. I contacted Happyfare again and they promptly provided me a link to generate boarding passes. Through this I could see my reservation along with others booked through them. I was able to check-in online and select my seat. On the day of travel, I arrived at the airport and had no issues at check-in or through security with my boarding pass in hand. My worries were put to rest. 
### Reaching my destination safely
The flight went smoothly and I arrived at my destination as planned. I was relieved the booking proved to be fully legitimate despite initial doubts. While the confirmation process was unfamiliar, Happyfare delivered as promised and helped me save hundreds on my **last minute international airfare**. I'm glad I took a chance with them and wanted to share my experience to provide reassurance for others in similar situations searching for affordable flight options.
### Responding to concerns and providing transparency
Upon my return, I saw that negative reviews of Happyfare continued to surface online. To help address ongoing concerns, I decided to share a detailed account of my experience. From my interactions with their customer support and the ease of check-in, it was clear to me Happyfare is a legit travel agency and not a scam as some reviews claimed. I understand the unfamiliar confirmation process could understandably raise doubts. However, Happyfare was fully transparent in explaining their process to me and came through without any issues. For someone like me searching for budget **last minute international flights**, they provided a great affordable option.
### Verifying the legitimacy and improving the experience  
To further validate Happyfare, I searched online and found they are a registered travel agency in India. This helped ease my remaining concerns about legitimacy. While the non-traditional confirmation method could be improved for a smoother customer experience, I believe Happyfare aims to deliver on their promises. For travelers on a budget like myself who are willing to try alternative options, Happyfare offers real savings and delivered a positive end result for my trip despite initial uncertainties. I'm glad I was able to provide a more balanced perspective based on my own experience actually booking and traveling with them.
### Conclusion and helping fellow travelers
In closing, I hope sharing the details of my Happyfare booking journey and smooth travel experience helps other travelers in similar situations. Budget travel often requires taking some risks but also doing thorough research. While not perfect, Happyfare legitimately came through for me when needed most. For those searching for affordable **last minute international airfare** and willing to try alternative options, I believe Happyfare deserves consideration. Please feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. I'm happy to share more of my insights to potentially help fellow travelers save on flights.
