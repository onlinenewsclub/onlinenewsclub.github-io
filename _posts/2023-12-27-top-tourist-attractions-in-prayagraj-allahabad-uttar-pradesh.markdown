Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad, is one of the most important pilgrimage centers for Hindus in northern India. The city is located along the banks of the sacred Ganga River and marks the site where this mighty river meets the Yamuna River and the symbolic Saraswati River. This holy confluence, known as Sangam, draws millions of pilgrims each year, especially during the Kumbh Mela festival. Beyond its religious significance, Prayagraj also has a rich cultural and historical heritage. Here are some of the top attractions to visit in this vibrant city of Uttar Pradesh:
### Khushro Bagh
This beautiful Mughal garden is a lovely spot to spend some time away from the crowds in the city. The well-manicured lawns and tranquil atmosphere are very calming. Look out for the [historical Mughal architecture](https://wordtimes.github.io/2024-01-09-mein-besuch-in-tadschikistan/) and fountains that add to the charm of Khushro Bagh. Make sure to stroll through the gardens in the early morning or evening hours to appreciate their beauty fully.

### Chandeshwari Azad Park  
Also known as Company Bagh, this lush park stands at the site of a former prison called Nani Jail. The park now pays tribute to the Indian revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad and houses a memorial dedicated to him. Come here to spend a relaxing afternoon surrounded by lush greenery. Donâ€™t miss the iconic peacock statue at the center of the park.
### Allahabad Museum
Considered one of the finest museums in northern India, the Allahabad Museum houses a world-class collection of rare artifacts, sculptures, and paintings. Of particular note are its collections related to the Indus Valley Civilization as well as Buddhist and Jain art. Explore over **50,000 objects of artistic, architectural and historical significance** spread across its well-curated galleries. 
### Akshayavat or Immortal Banyan Tree
Situated within the compound of Panchgayan Mahadev Temple, this giant banyan tree is quite literally immortal. Scientific studies have dated it to be over 3,000 years old, making it one of the oldest living trees in the world. Hindus believe it to be one of the plants that arose from the trunk of the original Bodhi tree under which Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment. Witnessing the massive tree and its intricately spreading aerial roots is a sight to behold.
### Swaraj Bhawan Museum 
Occupying the former residence of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, this museum offers insights into the Indian independence movement. Wander through rooms preserved exactly as they were during Nehru's time, learn about prominent nationalist leaders through rare photographs and documents **displayed here.** Don't miss the statue of Nehru behind the house overlooking the Ganges.
### Khuldabad 
Located around 15 km from the city amid picturesque countryside, Khuldabad is home to the dargah (mausoleum) of 18th century Sufi saint Ahmed Shah Abdul-Aziz. His samadhi (burial place) draws devotees from all faiths who come seeking blessings. Other historic mosques and tombs from the Mughal era also dot this serene town. Spend an afternoon taking in the peaceful ambience.
### Sangam Ghat 
Without a doubt, the most iconic site in Prayagraj is the Sangam Ghat - the sacred meeting point of the Ganga, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers. Thousands of Hindu devotees gather here every day for ritual bathing, prayers, and to observe breathtaking sunset and sunrise views. Join the daily crowds for a spiritual experience and don't forget to feed the playful monkeys! For panoramic city views, head to Sangam in the early morning or evening hours to avoid intense crowds. 
### Hanumana Setu
Constructed in 1992 on the lines of India's iconic Ram Setu, this 900m-long footbridge named after the devout monkey god Hanuman provides divine views of the triveni sangam. Built completely without cement and using just rocks, it's an architectural marvel worth appreciating. Cross over to the island in between for close-up glimpses of ritual performances and a meditative setting surrounded by sacred waters. 
### Allahabad Fort
Dating back to the 16th century Mughal era, this excellently preserved fort overlooking the confluence is one of Prayagraj's most important heritage monuments. Wander through its imposing arched gateways and corridors taking in traces of its glorious past. Look out for the Ashoka Pillar erected by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC within the fort premises. History buffs will greatly appreciate the chance to explore this medieval structure.
