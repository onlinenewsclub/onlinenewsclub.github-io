### Airline Preferences and Trip Experiences
Flying internationally can be a big commitment with long hours spent in transit. It's important to choose an airline and route that maximizes comfort. Based on multiple trips from North America to the Philippines over the past decade, [Delta Airlines](https://setit.github.io/_tabs/categories/) has provided the best overall experience. The 2019 flight onboard Delta was fairly comfortable with food I was familiar with. **Chinese Southern Airlines** was less preferred due to an uncomfortable seat during a layover in China on the first international trip. Avoiding layovers in **Communist China** is also preferable when possible.

### Recommending Philippine Airlines for Non-Stop Flights  
For direct flights from the west coast of North America to Manila, **Philippine Airlines** is highly recommended despite not being the cheapest or highest quality option. The 15-20 hour non-stop flight allows bypassing layovers altogether. Many travelers want to minimize stopovers as much as possible for convenience and a smoother travel experience. Direct flights on Philippine Airlines are available from Vancouver, Los Angeles, or San Francisco.
### Korean Air and Delta Provide Options from Chicago
Traveling from the Midwest, **Korean Air** and **Delta Airlines** offer good flight options that connect through Korea or other Asian hubs before continuing to the Philippines. Both airlines provide comfortable service and amenities on long-haul international routes. However, Korean Air flights often involve a connection at **Angeles City** which adds transfer time and cost for onward domestic travel within the Philippines compared to other Asian gateways.  
### Choosing American Airlines from Dallas
For trips originating in Texas, **American Airlines** provides direct service from Dallas to **Cebu**, one of the major airports in the Philippines that's more convenient than Manila for travelers continuing to other destinations in the Visayas or Mindanao regions. The Cebu airport tends to face less congestion issues than Manila as well. Dallas is also considered a better domestic hub than other US airports like Chicago or Los Angeles for connecting flights.
### San Francisco Outperforms Los Angeles
When flying out of California, data shows **San Francisco International Airport** experiences fewer delays and provides smoother connections compared to **Los Angeles International Airport**. Additionally, Asian network carriers like Philippine Airlines and Korean Air tend to offer more non-stop flights from San Francisco. This makes it the preferable gateway in California for travel to the Philippines and connections throughout Asia.
### Consider Business Class for Long Flights  
The long durations of 15-20 hours for non-stop flights from North America mean travelers should seriously consider booking in premium **Business Class** if their budgets allow. Both **Philippine Airlines** and **Korean Air** offer lie-flat seating and improved amenities in the premium cabins compared to **Cargo Class**. This helps maximize comfort and rest during the marathon journey across the Pacific Ocean when time spent in transit exceeds a full day. Unless dietary needs require American options, the Business Class service of Asian carriers suffices.
### Summary of Best Flight Options
To summarize the recommendations, flights should target the following routes and carriers when traveling from North America to the Philippines:
- **West Coast**: Non-stop on Philippine Airlines from Vancouver/Los Angeles/San Francisco for direct routing  
- **Chicago:** Connecting flights on Korean Air or Delta routing through Korea, Japan, or other Asian hubs
- **Texas:** Direct American Airlines flights from Dallas to Cebu  
- **California:** Fly out of San Francisco instead of Los Angeles when possible 
- **Long-Haul Flight**: Book Business Class on Philippine Airlines or Korean Air for maximum comfort on 15+ hour flights
Proper planning involving carrier selection, routes, and cabin class can help reduce travel time and maximize comfort when flying between North America and the Philippines. Direct non-stop flights are preferable when available.
