### Mind Your Manners at Mealtimes
Dining etiquette in Weihai differs slightly from other parts of China. For example, it is considered rude to leave **chopsticks resting horizontally** on your bowl between bites. Also avoid unnecessarily **clanking dishes or bowls** with utensils. When eating with elders, don't start your meal until given permission twice. These small gestures show respect for local customs.
### Steer Clear of Street Food
Unlike other tourist cities, Weihai's **street-side snacks** may not always be as hygienic as they appear. **Unpowered food stalls** especially pose risks in hot and rainy weather conditions. Opt instead for bigger restaurants where standards are more tightly regulated. Local **seafood hotpot** and **steamed bao** are definitely worth a try when dining in safer establishments.  
### Admire Coastal Scenery  
Weihai's scenic coastal setting along the **Bohai Gulf** is what draws many visitors. Don't miss the historic **Zhifu Road** lined with architectural landmarks. For panoramic ocean views, **Weihai Peninsula Park** offers hiking trails and scenic overlooks. Nearby **Chengyang Park** has charming gardens perfect for an afternoon stroll. Be sure to allow plenty of time to take in the natural beauty that earned Weihai its "Misty Rainy City" moniker.
### Experience Local Culture
Beyond sightseeing, getting to know Weihai's culture brings the city to life. Catch an **acrobatic performance** showcasing Shandong's unique skills. Browse stalls at the **Antique Market** to source curios and handicrafts. Sample traditional **bean curd and noodle dishes** highlighting regional flavors. Weihai also has a large Buddhist community - paying respects at the grand **Xiangganshan Temple** complex offers soulful respite from city activities. Cultural immersion provides wonderful memories to take back home. 
### Respect Boundaries with Locals  
As a conservative northern Chinese city, Weihai residents observe certain social norms. Overly **affectionate public displays** can cause embarrassment, so restrain impulses. Also, the elderly command a great deal of respect in line with Confucian ideals. Avoid actions like grabbing elders' attention vigorously or pushing ahead of them without asking. Earning trust through polite small talk and courtesy helps foster better connections with locals during your visit.
### Depart with Fond Memories of Weihai
No matter the weather, Weihai is a delight to discover through its people, landscapes, cuisine and heritage. Taking time to appreciate local nuances as outlined makes for a rich cultural experience beyond superficial tourism.
