### Getting to Chittagong 
The main gateway to Chittagong is [Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport](https://thetopnews.github.io/why-the-ps3-remains-a-solid-choice-over-newer-consoles/), located just outside the city. From here, you can take a taxi or ride-sharing service like **Uber** or **Pathao** to your hotel in the city. Be sure to have Bangladeshi Taka cash on hand as most drivers do not accept foreign currencies or credit cards. It's about a 30 minute ride to the city center depending on traffic.

### Choosing Accommodation
Chittagong offers accommodation options to suit all budgets. Top hotels near the airport like **Novotel Chittagong** and **Ruposhi Bangla Hotel** are more expensive but offer international standards of service and comfort. For a more local experience, consider staying in the city center where you'll be within walking distance of attractions. **Hotel Agrabad** and **Hotel InterContinental Chittagong** are good mid-range options located downtown. Budget travelers can check hostels or economical options on booking sites. 
### Exploring the City of Chittagong
With just 2-3 days, focus your time in Chittagong city itself. Top sights include **Patenga Beach**, a scenic stretch of sand just outside town. Nearby is the **Ahsan Manzil Museum**, a grand 19th-century mansion housing historical exhibits. In the heart of the city, don't miss the **Shaheed Minar** monument honoring Bangladesh's independence fighters. Wander the bustling streets around **Station Road** to experience the city's vibrant culture. Plan to spend half a day exploring each main attraction.
### Day Trips from Chittagong
With more time, venture outside the city for incredible natural scenery. One popular option is **Sajek Valley**, a mountainous region dubbed "Roof of Bangladesh". From Chittagong, the scenic 4-hour drive winds through tea plantations up to Sajek's cool highland climate. Book an overnight homestay through tour operators to fully take in the **picturesque views of Shimulia Peak**. Nature lovers should also put **Bandarban Hill Tracts** on their itinerary. Just 2.5 hours away, its rugged **jungles and ethnic villages** are highlights of a 1-2 night trip. 
### Authentic Food and Shopping
Bangladeshi cuisine shines in **Chittagong's bustling food stalls and markets**. Must-tries include **hilsa fish fry**, a local delicacy best enjoyed freshly prepared at Kalabagan market. For sweets, look for **shondesh** - rice flour balls dipped in coconut syrup. Bargain for handicrafts at **Bijay Nagar** which has everything from woodcarvings to fabrics. Clothes and electronics can also be picked up more cheaply here compared to other parts of Bangladesh. Leave room in your luggage for souvenirs!
### Getting Around Chittagong 
During your exploration of the scenic city, the main modes of transport are **foot** or **auto-rickshaw**. Most attractions are centrally located and easily walkable. For longer distances like to the beach, hop in a colorfully painted rickshaw - prices are low and haggling expected. Taking a rickshaw is also safer than walking alone at night. Ride-hailing services like **Uber** operate as well if you prefer air-conditioned comfort. Public buses also connect the outskirts but aren't as user-friendly for tourists. 
### Tips for Visiting Chittagong Safely
As with any emerging economy, minor precautions are prudent in Chittagong. **Only take licensed taxis from reputable companies**, especially at night. **Avoid deserted areas** and pay close attention in crowds where **pickpocketing can occur**. **Bargain prices clearly** before purchasing anything to avoid scams. Keep your **passport and valuables securely on your person**. Use **cash only** as credit cards aren't widely accepted. With sensible measures, you can safely enjoy all that Chittagong has to offer. Locals are generally quite friendly and helpful towards foreigners exploring their fascinating city.
### Extension to Cox's Bazar and St. Martin's Island 
No Bangladesh trip is complete without a visit to **Cox's Bazar**, home to the world's longest natural beach. From Chittagong, the scenic 4-hour drive southeast leads to over 100km of pristine coastline. Opt to spend 2+ days exploring the beach, sampling fresh seafood, and relaxing in beach huts. Day trips also operate from Cox's Bazar to scenic **St. Martin's Island** offshore. This idyllic coral islet is perfect for spotting dolphins and unwinding in a tropical paradise. Factor in budget for the enhanced experience of extending your Chittagong trip with these iconic Bangladeshi destinations.
