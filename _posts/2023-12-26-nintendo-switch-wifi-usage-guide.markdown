### Mandatory Updates Are Necessary for a Fulfilling Gaming Experience
Nintendo is well known for frequent **system and game software updates** that are released to keep games running smoothly and address any issues that arise. Many times a new update is **required** before you can even launch a game. An interesting example is the basketball simulation NBA Live 2021. Even if you purchase the physical cartridge version of the game, there is still a massive **33GB mandatory download** that is needed since the small amount of data on the cartridge only provides a portion of the full game experience. Not having the latest updates can negatively impact your ability to enjoy your Nintendo Switch games to their fullest potential online or with additional features.

### System Updates Are Quick But Important to Keep Your Switch Running Well
Anytime you insert a game cartridge requesting a newer **system firmware** than what is currently on your Nintendo Switch, it will automatically prompt you to download and install the update. Most system updates are relatively small, usually just a few hundred megabytes, and download fairly quickly over a stable Wi-Fi connection. Nintendo has done a great job at keeping these **essential system software patches** reasonably sized compared to updates for other competing console brands that can sometimes take 30 minutes or longer. The last system update I installed took only about 3 minutes to fully download and apply in the background. Keeping your Switch updated ensures compatibility with the latest games and fixes any bugs or exploits.
### Secondary Console Accounts Require Regular Online Verification 
If you have multiple people using a shared Nintendo Switch under different profiles, be aware that any **secondary account** will need to verify online each time a digital game is launched that was originally purchased through another user's account. This is Nintendo's way of validating **the actual owner** of the digital game license is present on the device. So whoever is playing on a secondary account may experience delays having to go online and wait for the verification check if they are not connected to the internet. Travelling Switch users should keep this limitation in mind if sharing their device.
### Browsing and Buying From the eShop Demands a Wi-Fi Connection
Surfing the digital shelves of the Nintendo eShop is a great way to discover new indie games and catch sales on major titles. However, you will need an active Wi-Fi connection any time you want to use the storefront to **search for games, view game pages, watch trailers** or complete a transaction. The Switch was not designed to browse large catalogues of content like the digital store offline. So make sure to have a connection handy if you see something interesting during a browsing session and want to take advantage of a deal before it expires.
### Online Gaming Relies on a Steady Wi-Fi Signal 
A huge part of the Nintendo Switch experience is playing your favorite games with others from around the world through online multiplayer modes. But enjoying games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, or Animal Crossing: New Horizons with friends **over the internet requires anconstant Wi-Fi signal** to maintain a smooth connection to Nintendo's game servers. Even intermittent disconnects of just a few seconds can cause lag and rubberbanding issues in fast-paced multiplayer. For the best results, ensure your Switch is in a location with a strong and reliable wireless connection for quality online sessions. 
### Switch Lite Also Benefits From Wi-Fi But Lacks Docked Mode
Even though the Switch Lite ditches the hybrid design of the original for a handheld-only form factor, it still has all the same **core online functionality through built-in Wi-Fi**. This includes access to system updates, browsing the Nintendo eShop digitally, and competing online against others worldwide. However, there are a few notable missing features like the **detachable Joy-Cons, HD Rumble effects,** and ability to **dock and play on a television.** To enjoy Bluetooth headphones with the Switch Lite or regular Switch, you will need the optional USB-C audio adapter for wireless audio.
### Don't Miss Out On HD Rumble With Switch Lite By Using Controllers 
One downside of the Switch Lite not having **removable Joy-Cons** is that games utilizing advanced haptic feedback like HD Rumble cannot be experience to their fullest potential without additional hardware. The solution is to pair either the official Nintendo Pro Controller via Bluetooth or detachable Joy-Cons from the standard Switch model. This allows Switch Lite owners to still get those immersive vibration effects in supported titles like 1-2-Switch that were designed around HD Rumble. Making use of extra controllers keeps Switch Lite gamers in the **loop for all control innovations.**
### High-Speed Wi-Fi Is Key For Quick Updates and Lag-Free Online Play
To get the most satisfying Nintendo Switch experience whether downloading updates or battling friends online, taking steps to ensure your home network connection is fast and reliable is paramount. Factors like being within close range of your router, using the **5GHz Wi-Fi band** for more bandwidth, and making sure your internet subscription hasenough bandwidth available for multiple devices makes a big difference. The Switch performs best on a steady network connection of at least **20Mbps download speeds.** Avoid public hotspots with unstable signals for critical multiplayer sessions that demand low latency. A premium Wi-Fi setup aids smooth downloads and network performance.
