Ankara is Turkey's capital and second largest city after Istanbul. While it may lack some of the cultural allure of Istanbul, Ankara has a lot to offer visitors in terms of heritage sites, nature escapes and modern conveniences. Here are some insights into what you can experience while travelling to Ankara.
### Historic Places  
One of the top attractions is **Anıtkabir (Mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk)**, the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey. Visitors can tour the grounds and learn about Atatürk's role in establishing modern Turkey through exhibits in the small museum. Another notable ancient site is the [Temple of Augustus](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-03-u4e4c-u5e72-u8fbe-u4e4b-u65c5/) located in the Ulus district, built during Roman rule over the region. History buffs will enjoy the **Museum of Anatolian Civilizations** which houses artifacts spanning prehistory to classical antiquity.

### Parks and Gardens 
Ankara is known for its abundance of green spaces. Some top choices include **Kugulu Park** with its picnic spots and walking trails, and **Segmenler Parkı** near Atatürk Airport, offering lush lawns, playgrounds and views of the city skyline. Visitors can unwind while taking in the natural beauty found throughout Ankara.
### Shopping and Dining
Modern shopping malls like **Kentpark** and **Next Level** house international brands and local shops under one roof. For a more pedestrian-friendly atmosphere, **Tunalı Hilmi Caddesi** lined with boutiques and cafes is a lively area. Fine dining and casual eateries catering to all budgets can be found downtown or in malls. International dishes are readily available alongside traditional Turkish fare.  
### Architecture 
Landmarks like the **Ziraat Bank Headquarters** built in the 1920s showcase Ankara's early modern architecture. Government buildings and structures from the 1960s in **Ulus** reflect the shift to wider boulevards and marble-clad structures. Even the **Railway Station** is a handsome example of historical architecture. Strolling through the historic quarters, visitors appreciate Ankara’s development over time.
### Nightlife and Entertainment
Though lacking the vibrant arts scene of larger cities, Ankara offers diverse events year-round. Iconic venues like the **Congresium Ankara** host **international concerts, musicals,** comedy acts and more. For a dose of local culture, check schedules for performances at smaller theatres and the **State Opera and Ballet**. Pubs and lounges cater to night owls seeking entertainment into the late hours.
### Getting Around  
As Turkey's second largest city, Ankara has efficient public transportation. The new **metro system** composed of three lines connects key areas like the airport, stations and shopping districts. Buses are another affordable option though routes may be less direct. For independent exploration, short-term car rentals are available near stations. Well-marked streets and major thoroughfares make navigation straightforward.
### Challenges for Foreigners
While safety is generally not an issue, language barriers can pose difficulties in Ankara where English proficiency is relatively low compared to touristic Istanbul. Stick to centrally located and tourist-frequented areas for the greatest comfort level. Lonely Planete
