### Low Cost of Living and Budget Friendly Activities  
The cost of living in Egypt is remarkably affordable compared to other parts of the world. Well-located apartments in major cities like Cairo can be rented for a fraction of the price in Western nations. Public transportation is also dirt cheap with the metro system providing an efficient way to navigate sprawling urban areas. There is no shortage of free and budget-friendly activities such as walking along the Nile Corniche or visiting local markets and mosques. World-class museums like the Egyptian Museum in Cairo also charge only nominal entry fees. 
### Warm Climate and Outdoor Activities
The Egyptian climate is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts, with warm weather for most of the year. Winter temperatures remain mild, rarely dipping below 60°F/15°C. It is also rare for there to be heavy rain or snow storms that could disrupt outdoor plans. The Red Sea coast has beautiful beaches and reefs ideal for **snorkeling and scuba diving**. Hikers and climbers can explore the mountain ranges found in the Eastern Desert and Sinai Peninsula. History buffs will love visiting ancient archaeological sites like the Pyramids of Giza and Valley of the Kings. 
### Abundant Cultural and Culinary Experiences
Egypt has a rich cultural heritage spanning thousands of years. Visitors have the unique chance to immerse themselves in this vibrant culture through food, art, music and traditions still practiced today. Local Egyptian and Levantine cuisines offer tasty and healthy options like _koshary_ (mix of rice, lentils, macaroni), _fiteer_ (Egyptian pizza), and refreshing juices made from guava, tamarind or hibiscus. Various art forms still thrive such as modern and classical Arabic music, folk dancing, textiles weaving and pottery making. Major cities also host international performances and artistic events throughout the year.
### Educational and Volunteer Opportunities  
Egypt offers young people a low-cost way to gain international experience through volunteer and educational programs. Organizations like AIESEC provide the opportunity for volunteers under 30 to participate in community projects in fields like teaching, healthcare and rural development. Most programs cover housing and food expenses, only requiring volunteers to pay for their flight and pocket money. University students can apply for longer term programs through partnerships between international and Egyptian schools. Those with university degrees qualify for paid internships in sectors such as business, engineering and digital media.
### Helpful Social and Religious Etiquette
While Egypt is a conservative Muslim-majority country, locals are very friendly and hospitable to foreigners of all backgrounds. A few tips for visitors to respect local customs: dress modestly covering shoulders and knees; only shake hands with the same gender and seek permission before photographing people; be respectful in places of worship by removing shoes and keeping a low profile; use your right hand for eating and greeting and say _"As-salamu alaykum"_ when greeted. Overall, Egyptians are welcoming to respectful travelers and following basic etiquette helps one feel at ease in this historic multicultural society.
### Vibrant Markets and Street Food Culture 
Shopping for goods in Egypt gives a sensory experience through the bustle of local markets. Head to the Khan el-Khalili bazaar in Cairo to find copperware, spices, lanterns, backgammon sets and more. Bargaining is expected for non-fixed price items. Egypt also boasts a celebrated street food culture affordable even for budget travelers. Staple dishes like _kushari_ (mix of rice, lentils, macaroni and garlic vinegar), ful medames (stewed fava beans) and shawarma pita sandwiches can be found for just a few dollars. Bakeries sell fresh pita bread all day. Juice stands offer seasonal mixes of guava, tamarind, lime and more. Meals tend to be served and eaten family style among lively crowds.
### Friendly Cities and Natural Landscapes
While Cairo is the largest city with over 20 million residents, there are appealing smaller cities to explore as well. Alexandria on the northern coast combines Greek, Roman and Islamic architecture with a seafront promenade. Luxor in Upper Egypt offers exquisite pharaonic temples and the rugged Eastern Desert nearby is great for multi-day trekking adventures. The stunning mountains and beaches of the Sinai Peninsula attract hikers, mountain bikers, windsurfers and scuba divers. Oasis towns like Siwa and Bahariya preserve a simpler pace of life. Across its diverse natural scenery and communities, Egypt proves itself a welcoming place for residents and travelers alike.
### Easy Immigration Process for Foreign Citizens
Compared to other nations, Egypt has a relatively simple immigration process. Most nationalities can obtain single or multiple entry tourist visas on arrival at Egyptian ports of entry. For longer stays or work visas, applications can be made at an Egyptian embassy before travel. Investors and business owners can acquire long term residency visas by contributing to the local economy. Self-employed foreigners or those with active income from abroad can establish residency. Students obtain visas through their universities. Overall, following basic procedures like visa validation for tourists makes settling in Egypt seamless for most. Friendly rules and low costs of living make the country attractive for both short and long term foreign residents.
