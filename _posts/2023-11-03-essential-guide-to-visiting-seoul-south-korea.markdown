### Getting Settled in Seoul
When first arriving in Seoul, there are a few essential things to take care of to get settled. One of the first steps is to purchase a T-Money card, which serves as Seoul's transit card for the metro, buses, and taxis. T-Money cards can be purchased at most convenience stores and topped up with funds for travel around the city. Downloading mapping and transportation apps like the Seoul subway map on Kakao is also a must to navigate the excellent metro system. Speaking of transportation, consider flying domestic routes that use CALT (City Airport Terminal) to skip long immigration lines at Incheon International Airport. 
Settling into accommodation is also important. In Seoul, key money or large security deposits on apartments can be quite high, sometimes over $100,000 USD in popular areas. Budget accordingly or search for neighborhoods with more reasonable deposits. For basic household items, shopping destinations like Namdaemun Market offer inexpensive finds like socks, underwear and more in its packed alleyways. Larger supermarket chains like Emart also sell household goods alongside groceries.

### Exploring Urban Attractions in Seoul
With transportation and lodging sorted, it's time to explore Seoul's top attractions. A popular first stop is Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of the city's five grand palaces. Plan at least two hours to wander its sprawling palace grounds filled with history. Nearby areas like **Bukchon Hanok Village, Changdeokgung Palace** and Insadong are also worth visiting in a single day trip but allow extra time to fully appreciate each destination. 
For panoramic city views, head up Naksan Park in the evening for scenic sunsets or visit iconic Namsan Tower, a must-see for any Seoul trip. The Han River also offers beautiful perspectives, through a [day or night river cruise](https://codeces.github.io/2024-01-08-xc7ek-cumhuriyeti-nde-tek-ba-u015f-u0131na-seyahat-en-u0130yi-yerleri-ke-u015ffetmek/) along its banks or floating island water shows. Amusement seekers can check out Lotte World, an indoor theme park, or for the braver, ascend Lotte World Tower for 360-degree vistas from the observatory or death-defying glass floor viewing decks.
Seoul's food scene should not be missed either. Browse the bustling stalls and eateries at markets like Namdaemun for tasty street foods or fill up at the ingredient-rich food courts hidden in malls and department stores. Some popular local chains for filling meals on a budget include Paris Baguette for pastries and coffee or Paik's Coffee for cheaper alternatives to international franchises. 
### Discovering Seoul's Rich Culture
Beyond sightseeing, delve deeper into Seoul's cultural treasures. The National Museum of Korea houses an excellent collection of artifacts shedding light on the country's history and traditions. On the same grounds, the small but fascinating Hanbok Museum details the evolution of the iconic Korean attire. For a peek into traditional village lifestyle, check out the Folk Museum located within Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds.
Seoul is also a sports-loving city. Catching a professional baseball game adds a unique experience with rowdy cheerleaders and call-and-response chants led by passionate "ajushi" leaders. Catching a KTX high-speed train to the southern port city of Busan makes for a fun day trip too. Spend a few hours exploring Busan's beaches, temples and cultures. 
Beyond the big-ticket spots, appreciate Seoul's subtler charms too. Stroll through charming neighborhoods like Insadonggil for antique browsing or Ihwa Mural Village for outdoor street art. Enjoy seasonal delicacies like hallabong oranges, jujubes or hearty persimmons at the market. Experience the efficiency, speed and manners of Korean service culture whether dining out or shopping.
### More Urban Adventuring in Seoul
With a few nights in Seoul, pack in more experiences. Catch a contemporary performance or exhibition at an art center in sketchier Hongdae or dressed-up Gangnam. Burn calories hiking mountainous routes like Naksan or Bugaksan before winding down over hotteok or tteokbokki snacks. Shop the bustling alleys of Myeongdong for cosmetics, accessories and high-street brands.
Experience cutting-edge Korean cinema in one of the plush multi-screen complexes showing latest films with English subtitles. Learn to cook dishes like bulgogi beef or kimchi jjigae stew at a hands-on cooking class. Immerse in Seoul's colorful nightlife across lively districts like Itaewon or Gangnam filled with international cuisines, nightclubs and cocktail bars well past midnight. Slow down with soothing tea ceremonies or relaxation spas incorporating traditional Korean wellness practices. 
### Escaping to Nearby Getaways
With several days in Seoul, budget time to escape the city too. Take a quick day trip by rail to the coastal city of Busan as mentioned, or head south to the island of Jeju known for beaches, volcanic landscapes and Hallim Park's lush forest trails. Closer to Seoul, visit the royal town of Suwon with its UNESCO-listed fortress walls or relaxed resort town of Yangpyeong filled with hot springs, hiking paths and farm experiences. Multi-day itineraries can explore other famous regions like the architectural splendors and temples of Gyeongju or scenery of Gangwon Province up along the coastal road.
### Farewell to Seoul
All too soon, your Seoul adventure comes to an end. Before departing, soak in more local experiences. Sample sizzling Korean BBQ with meat, seafood and banchan sides. Visit bustling traditional markets like Dongdaemun or relaxing tearooms for traditional dal, hangwa sweets and steaming herb tea. Savor wholesome homecooked meals full of rice, kimchi and jeotgal fermented seafood at a hanjeongsik restaurant. 
Browse record shops, used bookstores or noraebang (karaoke) rooms for last minute souvenirs. Follow social media of favorite cafes, restaurants or boutiques discovered to plan for your next Seoul visit. Share memories with new Korean friends made along the journey who invite you "ganeunge" or back again soon. Farewell Seoul - until the next adventure begins!
