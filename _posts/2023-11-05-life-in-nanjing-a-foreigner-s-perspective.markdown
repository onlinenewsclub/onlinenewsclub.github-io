Nanjing is a fascinating city in eastern China with a rich history and culture. As both a long-time resident and recent expatriate can attest, it offers foreigners an affordable place to live with certain advantages and disadvantages compared to other major Chinese cities.
### Adjusting to the Climate  
One of the biggest adjustments for foreigners in Nanjing is dealing with the drastic temperature changes between summer and winter. [Humid subtropical climate](https://texaspost.github.io/2024-01-03-how-getting-out-of-your-comfort-zone-and-playing-coed-soccer-changed-my-life/) can make the heat overwhelming, with summer highs often exceeding 100Â°F. Evenings provide little relief without air conditioning. Lasting several days without working AC like during a power outage is a real struggle. Winters also see temperatures plummet well below freezing, though lack of central heating in homes means indoor and outdoor temperatures are nearly identical. Adaptive layers of warm clothing are essential during the colder months.
