### Malaysia and Cambodia
The **two-month Southeast Asia trip** would need to be carefully planned to fit so many countries into a tight schedule. Starting in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** makes the most sense logistically, as it is a major transportation hub with many direct flight connections throughout the region. Spend around a week exploring the diverse attractions of [Peninsular Malaysia](https://thetopnews.github.io/the-console-war-looking-back-at-the-launch-of-the-playstation-4-and-xbox-one/), including cities like Malacca with its Portuguese and Dutch colonial history. 
From Kuala Lumpur, take a short direct flight to **Phnom Penh, Cambodia** and spend 5 days soaking up the unique culture and colonial architecture, as well as somber sights related to the Khmer Rouge regime. Be sure to book tours of the S-21 prison and Choeung Ek killing fields to learn about Cambodia's tragic past. While the capital has enough to keep one busy for half a week, consider also taking a day trip to the idyllic coastal town of Sihanoukville or ruins of Angkor Borei if time allows.

### Indonesia and Borneo
Fly north from Phnom Penh into Indonesia. Spend around 10 days island hopping between destinations in **Java and Bali**. Trade winds Java's historical cities like Yogyakarta, Surakarta and Bandung, as well as the magnificent Hindu-Buddhist temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. Then take a short flight to **Bali** and spend a few days each in Seminyak, Ubud and coastal Semarapura, taking in the lush scenery, world-class surfing, and lively cultural shows. 
The next stop is **East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah)** on the island of Borneo. Take a ferry from Java to the Malaysian state capital Kuching and spend 3-4 days exploring the city's ethnic neighborhoods, rainforests and orangutan sanctuaries. From here, make the jump over to Sabah and spend the remaining time on Borneo island in spectacular mountain towns like Kota Kinabalu and rural longhouses. Wind down the Malaysia portion of the trip with a return flight to Kuala Lumpur.
### Philippines
Fly south to the **Philippines** for the final 10 days of the trip. Base yourself in bustling Manila for a few days of urban discovery. Make sure to visit cultural landmarks like Intramuros and the nightly outdoor markets in Binondo. Then head to tropical Boracay island for 4-5 days of pristine beaches, water sports and late-night parties before catching an international flight home from Manila.
### Food, Transportation and Accommodations 
On a budget, much of the **intra-Asia transportation** can be done via affordable buses, trains and boats, while saving flights for longer distances. Opt for local eateries, street food and modest guesthouses/hotels to keep costs low. With some forward planning on transit and lodging bookings, this packed itinerary allows one to experience the vibrant cultures and landscapes of **Malaysia, Indonesia, Borneo and the Philippines** within the tight 40-day timeframe. While the daily pace is fast, the dizzying array of sights and experiences would leave many lifelong memories of this rich corner of Asia.
### Revised Itinerary for 46 Days
While 40 days is rushed, expanding the trip duration to mid-March through end of April allows for a slightly less hectic pace with a few more comfortable buffer days in each destination. Here is a revised 46-day itinerary:
### Malaysia and Cambodia 
Spend 2 weeks exploring Peninsular Malaysia, with 3 days each in Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and the Cameron Highlands. Then fly to Cambodia and devote a full week to the sights in and around Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, including a few days at Angkor Wat. 
### Indonesia 
Spend 2 weeks island hopping around Indonesia. Allocate 4-5 days each on Java visiting Yogyakarta, Bandung and Surakarta, as well as Bali with split time between Seminyak, Ubud and Candidasa on the eastern coast. 
### Borneo
Take the ferry from Bali to Kuching in East Malaysia and spend a leisurely 5 days exploring the city, orangutan sanctuaries and national parks. Then travel up to Sabah's Mt. Kinabalu andTawau, spending another 5 days trekking and soaking up the scenery. 
### Philippines
Conclude with 3 weeks in the Philippines. Spend a week in Manila with day trips to nearby destinations like Calamba and Los Ba√±os. Allocate 5-6 days on Boracay and another 5 days splitting time between Cebu, Bohol and Siargao island. 
With this adjusted itinerary providing more buffer days, travelers can fully immerse themselves in each locale without feeling rushed. The expanded timeline also allows for unexpected delays or extra spontaneous excursions if desired.
By strategically reworking the countries and durations visited, it is completely possible to experience the highlights of Southeast Asia on a budget within the 46-day timeframe while enjoying a slightly less hectic pace. Proper planning remains essential to get the most from this memorable multi-country adventure.
