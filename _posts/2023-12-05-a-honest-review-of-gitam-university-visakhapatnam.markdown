### The High Cost of Education 
GITAM University charges exorbitantly high fees that put financial burden on students and their families. The annual college fee alone is Rs. 2,25,000 while hostel and food expenses add another Rs. 4,00,000, totaling to **Rs. 6,25,000 per year**. For a 4-year undergraduate degree, the total direct cost of education exceeds **Rs. 25 lakhs**, a massive amount for average Indian families to afford. Many struggle to pay such steep tuition and end up accumulating [heavy educational loans](https://thetopnews.github.io/everything-you-need-to-know-about-charging-your-xbox-one-controller/) that take years to repay after graduation.

### Average Academic Standards and Absence of Placements  
While GITAM markets itself as a premium institution, the actual educational quality and standards are average. Classes are large with minimal faculty interaction. Core subjects like **Immunology** are allegedly taught poorly with **nepotism and favoritism** in grading. Very few reputed companies actively recruit from GITAM, undermining the value of degrees. With minimal campus placements, students have difficulties securing well-paying jobs matching their educational investment of crores of rupees. Overall, the university fails to deliver quality education commensurate with its exorbitant tuition fees.
### Unfair Evaluation and Failure of Deserving Students
Several instances of unfair practices in student evaluation have been reported. Hardworking students with a consistent history of good grades are unexpectedly failed in multiple subjects due to subjective, ambiguous criteria. Even after revaluation attempts by paying additional fees, some persistently fail to pass. In contrast, academically weaker students somehow manage to pass or clear all subjects with minimal effort. Such biased grading casts doubts on the transparency and integrity of GITAM's **student assessment system**. It severely demotivates sincere students while benefiting undeserving ones, undermining the value of degrees awarded.
### Abysmal Hostel Living Conditions  
Along with exorbitant fees, sub-par hostel facilities are another major issue. Air conditioning is rarely used despite tropical weather conditions. **Overcrowded rooms**, shared bathrooms and poorly maintained infrastructure make daily living very uncomfortable. Basic amenities expected in a residential campus of a private university are not provided. Students are made to pay lakhs in fees yet forced to endure unacceptable living standards that could undermine their academic performance and well-being. There seems to be little oversight or accountability for proper utilization and allocation of massive tuition fees collected every year.
### Allegations of Administrators Misusing Power and Resources 
Some former faculties allege instances of **blatant power abuse and corruption** at higher administrative levels. Students compliant of impartial grading are allegedly threatened or victimized despite paying hefty donations. Top positions are held by individuals accused of **nepotism and inefficient resource utilization**. Campus placement cells lack initiative and networks to secure reputed recruiters. Instead, the prime focus seems to be aggressively marketing and "poaching" fresh enrollments through misleading promotions while squeezing existing students for maximum fees with minimal accountability on deliverables.
### Alternative Education Options Provide Better Value
Given the legitimate concerns around academic rigor, impartial evaluation, campus life quality and post-study career prospects, GITAM may not be the most prudent investment for aspiring students and families looking for a quality **technical education**. Numerous other reputed private universities and state-funded institutes in the same geographic region offer comparable degrees at a fraction of the cost with better learning outcomes. While brand prestige attracts some, a more pragmatic choice would be to consider alternative options evaluated through factual Due Diligence for truly empowering one's career and future through higher education.
### Conclusion: Caution Advised On Joining GITAM 
In summary, while GITAM is undeniably one of the largest private universities in South India with several decades of legacy, the actual experience of existing and former students paint a very different picture from the marketing hype. Massive tuition fee burden, opaque student evaluation, sub-par living standards and lack of post-study career opportunities undermine the true value proposition. Allegations of administrative misconduct remain unaddressed. Unless substantive positive changes are immediately implemented, aspiring students and parents are advised to cautiously weigh all options and possibly avoid joining GITAM to avoid potential regrets down the line. Due diligence beyond promotional advertisements is essential to make an informed choice, protecting one's valuable time and investment in higher education.
