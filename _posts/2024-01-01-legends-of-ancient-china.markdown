Historical fiction is one of the most interesting genres for exploring cultures of the past. Two prominent legends emerge from ancient Chinese history - the tale of devoted sworn brothers Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi, and the legendary warrior Lü Bu. While their circumstances differed, both stories exemplify the strengths, bonds and complexities of human nature.
### Calming Song
Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi shared an [unbreakable bond of deep affection](https://thetopnews.github.io/page16/) despite coming from rival clans. During their time trapped in a cave, Lan WangJi composed a soothing song called "**WangXian**" and played it only for Wei WuXian. Years later, when the demonic cultivator Wen Ning went berserk on Mount Dafan, Wei WuXian instinctively played the same calming melody. Upon hearing it, Wen Ning was pacified, and Lan WangJi realized the song's player could only be Wei WuXian.

### Family Beyond Blood   
Formal adoption was a common practice in historical East Asia, allowing families to continue their lineage. However, in some cases adoption served another purpose - to recognize profound interpersonal relationships that transcended typical boundaries. Such atypical bonds, if deemed sincere, could be accepted in moderation by broader society. For Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi, whose deep affection persisted into adulthood, a ceremonial adoption may have provided a meaningful way to affirm their unwavering loyalty and care for one another.
### Peerless Warrior
Lü Bu was renowned across China for his superhuman martial prowess in battle. Accounts describe his immense physical strength, lightning-fast blade skills, and peerless archery accuracy on horseback. No opponent could match Lü Bu's ferocity. However, for all his valor, Lü Bu's own hubris would prove his undoing. Unable to submit loyally to any leader for long, Lü Bu's habitual betrayals and arrogance ultimately led to his downfall. Though mighty, Lü Bu's legend shows how even the greatest warriors remain human, and highlights valor's necessity for virtue. 
### Entwined Destinies 
Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi's bond proved strong enough to endure great strain. During the Sunshot Campaign aimed against the **demonic cult**, they fought relentlessly side by side. Yet after a tragic incident where Wei WuXian was fatally wounded, Lan WangJi was driven to the brink of madness by grief. Only years later, when clues emerged that Wei WuXian still lived, did Lan WangJi's will to endure return. Their story of deep devotion even in death's shadow reminds us that relationships can transcend all trials given an unyielding, **selfless love**.
### A Complex Legacy
Lü Bu left a complex legacy as one of history's most renowned warriors. Accounts describe a man of unmatched martial talent, yet equally flawed by his prideful nature. While peers respected Lü Bu's battle mastery, his disloyalty sowed the seeds of his downfall. Like no other, Lü Bu represented the heights to which human ability can soar, yet also served as a warning of virtues' importance to sustain even the mightiest. His legend endures as a reminder of humanity's potential for both greatness and frailty within each person.  
### Unbreakable Vows  
Throughout their lives, Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi supported each other unwaveringly, as symbolized by their ** sworn brotherhood vows**. Even death could not sever the profound bond they shared. Years after Wei WuXian's supposed demise, Lan WangJi persisted in his solitary mourning - until fate brought clues that rekindled his hope. As past tales long captivated by their story of eternal loyalty, so too would future generations be inspired by these figures whose devotion proved stronger than the grave. The depth of care between these sworn brothers shows how through sincerity, human connections can transcend all worldly constraints.
### A Legacy of Strength and Virtue
Whether in fabled legends like those of Lü Bu or the real devotion between Wei WuXian and Lan WangJi, ancient China's tales imparted virtues that still resonate. Their legends remind us that while martial prowess and talents may garner renown, strength of character proves far more heroic and enduring. Virtues like loyalty, empathy and sincerity forge bonds deeper than any talent alone. Though centuries divide us, figures like these two sworn brothers continue inspiring new generations with their reminder that however trying life's journey, human hearts can overcome all so long as we uphold compassion and walk together bound by care, not circumstance. Their legacy endures.
