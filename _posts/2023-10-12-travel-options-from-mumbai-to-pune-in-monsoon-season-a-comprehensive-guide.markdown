Traveling by train, bus or shared taxi - here is an in-depth look at the pros and cons of each transport option from Mumbai to Pune during monsoon season.
### Train: The Most Scenic and Comfortable Option
Traveling by train provides the most scenic route through the Western Ghats, especially during monsoon season when waterfalls are in full flow. Some key points about train travel:
- Travel time averages 3-4 hours on [trains like Sahyadri Express](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-03-budget-et-conseils-pour-un-voyage-de-10-jours-au-japon/) which run daily between Mumbai and Pune. This is one of the fastest modes of transportation between the two cities. 
- Trains run during both day and night, offering flexibility. You have a choice between 2nd class chair car, AC chair car, sleeper class and AC sleeper depending on your budget and comfort needs.
- The route passes through Karjat and Lonavla stations, offering beautiful views of the green hills, valleys, villages and waterfalls dotted along the railway tracks. During monsoon, the views are exceptionally picturesque.
- Traveling by train is very safe and punctual. You can relax comfortably during the journey and reach your destination well-rested. However, trains may not be convenient if you need to reach Mumbai early for morning meetings or appointments.

### Bus: A Convenient Option for Early Arrivals  
Bus travel averages 4-5 hours with stoppages along the way. Key aspects to consider:
- Buses like **Shivneri** run frequently between Mumbai and Pune, with early morning services that can get you to Mumbai by 10am. This makes bus a good option if you need to be in Mumbai city for meetings or work.
- The scenic ghat section between Karjat and Lonavla is traversed, though views may not be as extensive as from train windows. Traffic restrictions during heavy rains can sometimes cause delays.  
- Buses usually stop for refreshments in Khalapur or Lonavla where you can grab a quick snack. Toilet stops are also provided enroute.
- Though slightly more bumpy than trains, buses offer door-to-door connectivity and the option to alight nearer to your final destination within the city compared to train stations.
### Shared Taxis/Private Cabs: The Fastest Route
For those seeking the quickest route between Mumbai and Pune, shared taxis and private cabs are best although they involve a few compromises:
- Dedicated taxi services like **Black & Yellow** ply frequently with a travel time of around 3 hours including one brief comfort stop.
- Private hired cabs like **Ola or Uber** provide a door-to-door service in approximately same time while ensuring privacy and safety in your own vehicle. 
- However, cramped seating and unknown fellow passengers make shared taxis the least safe and comfortable mode compared to buses and trains.
- Private cabs are more expensive but give peace of mind as you can customize your journey details like pick-up/drop-off times and locations. 
- During monsoons, landslides or traffic jams due to waterlogging could potentially delay taxis where there is no alternate route like in trains. 
So in summary, trains provide the scenic experience while buses are convenient for early arrivals. Taxis are fastest but shared options involve more risks. Consider your priorities and flexibilities before deciding on the best travel option between Mumbai to Pune especially during the picturesque monsoon season.
### Making the Most of Your Journey
No matter which mode of transport you choose, here are some tips to make the most of your Mumbai-Pune journey during monsoons:
- Carry snacks, water and entertainment like books/movies on your device to pass time enjoyably. 
- Travel light and keep valuables and electronic items securely with you instead of luggage. 
- In buses/trains, sit on the right side for scenic views of waterfalls in ghat areas like Karjat. 
- Carry a raincoat/umbrella as weather can change quickly in these hilly regions. 
- Enjoy local snacks like bhajji, vada pav served at food stalls in Khalapur, Lonavla while relaxing during halt.
- Track live train/bus schedules on apps like **IRCTC Trains** or **CTS Mumbai** to avoid any last-minute hassles.
- Consider overnight journeys on **Sahyadri Express** for a peaceful post-work travel experience.
With proper planning and choosing the right mode, your Mumbai-Pune commute during monsoons can be both comfortable and memorable with lush green scenery all around. Happy and safe travels!
