### Making Mexico City a Permanent Home
After spending many years living between Benito Juarez and Cuajimalpa, the two safest boroughs in Mexico City, I decided to settle down permanently in Cuajimalpa. While Benito Juarez has been a great place to live with low crime rates, Cuajimalpa offered me better proximity to work, family, and friends. Beyond public safety, Cuajimalpa also has the advantage of being built on solid rock, providing greater earthquake protection compared to softer soils in other areas. Overall, Mexico City has been a wonderful place to call home.

### The Warmth and Generosity of Mexican People 
[Mexican hospitality](https://elviaje.github.io/2024-01-09-visado-de-tr-xe1nsito-a-los-estados-unidos-y-canad-xe1-reglas-y-recomendaciones/) is something I have always appreciated most about living here. Despite hardships, Mexicans remain happy, friendly, and welcoming to outsiders. As a non-Mexican resident, I have never felt as accepted anywhere else as I do in Mexico. The people are incredibly polite and make daily interactions a pleasure. Their kindness and generosity is what makes Mexico City such a joy to reside in long-term.
### Authentic Mexican Cuisine is a Delight
Mexican food goes well beyond the Tex-Mex offered in most American restaurants. **Home-cooked Mexican meals** prepared with fresh, local ingredients and bold seasonal flavors are truly unmatched. Having easy access to real, traditional Mexican cooking is a huge benefit of living in this city. From street tacos to mole poblano, I never grow tired of sampling Mexico's incredible culinary creations on a daily basis. The food alone makes residing in Mexico worth it.
### Ideal Year-Round Temperate Climate  
After many cold Chicago winters, the weather in Mexico City is heavenly. During fall, winter, and spring, daytime highs hover around 80°F with cool evenings dipping to the low 60°s. Having consistent **temperate weather** allows outdoor activities and relaxation year-round. Neither extreme heat nor freezing conditions exist here. The climate is optimal for an active lifestyle and makes long-term living highly appealing. I have become completely accustomed to Mexico's comfortable temperatures.
### Exploring Mexico City's Historic Center
With so much history concentrated downtown, it is easy to while away entire days walking neighborhoods like the Alameda and Zocalo. No trip is complete without browsing **Mexico City's art scene** in neighborhoods such as the Centro and Condesa. World-class museums exhibiting pre-Columbian artifacts and colonial art line the Paseo de la Reforma. Evenings are best spent relaxing in tree-lined parks or at outdoor plazas. The abundant culture accessible within a short distance is truly unparalleled.
### Keeping Safety in Mind After Dark  
While most areas are safe during daylight, using common sense precautions at night is recommended. My friend and I once took a wrong turn down an unlit side street after an afternoon of sightseeing, finding it eerily dark and deserted late in the evening. In general, sticking to well-lit, populated neighborhoods reduces risk. **Mexico City nightlife** offers ample activities, but having local knowledge of which areas to avoid alone after dark helps maximize enjoyment and peace of mind.
### Making Mexico City a Lifelong Home
All these years later, I still feel the same strong attraction to living in Mexico City permanently. The people, food, weather, and cultural riches have made it an incredibly enjoyable place to reside long-term. Although other locations may offer lower crime rates, Mexico City's appeal as my home far outweighs any occasional safety concerns, which are mostly avoidable through basic awareness. I look forward to creating many more memories here for years to come.
