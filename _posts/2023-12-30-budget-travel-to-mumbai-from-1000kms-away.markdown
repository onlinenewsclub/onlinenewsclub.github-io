Maharashtra is home to the bustling metropolis of Mumbai, India's entertainment and business capital. However, living 1000kms away can make frequent trips challenging due to the distance and associated costs. In this guide, we explore affordable travel and accommodation options for visiting Mumbai on a budget.
### Making the journey 
Travelling 1000kms is no small feat, so planning your mode of transportation is key. [Sleeper coach buses](https://wordtimes.github.io/2024-01-09-die-komplizierte-geschichte-monegas-und-seiner-sprachen/) are a popular and cost-effective choice, with fares of **1800-1900 INR one-way**. For around the same price, you could also consider **taking the train** in an AC 3-tier sleeper carriage. Both modes allow you to relax during the long journey.

Additionally, Dabbawalas provide an incredibly cheap **home-cooked lunch meal for 50-100 rupees** daily if pre-ordered.  
### Experiencing south Mumbai culture
Venturing to the southern districts allows experiencing Mumbai's colonial architecture and culture. Allocate a day to wander around heritage areas like **Fort, Churchgate and Cuffe Parade**. Many prominent landmarks like the High Court and Gateway of India are located here. Low-cost activities like people watching make for memorable experiences without breaking the bank.
### Budget dining and nightlife in Bandra and Goregaon
For inexpensive dining, head to the suburbs of Bandra and Goregaon. Udupi-style cafeterias here serve generous **thali meals from 100-200 rupees** containing rice, dal, vegetables and dessert. Youthful Bandra West also has lively pubs and bars. Affordable yet eclectic music venues like **AntiSocial** host local indie acts on weekends from **500 rupees cover charge**.
