### Securing Visas Before International Travel
When traveling internationally with dual citizenship, it's important to research visa requirements for all countries you will visit. [visa application procedures](https://thetopnews.github.io/playstation-5-dualsense-controller-on-pc-an-unmatched-gaming-experience/) vary between nationalities. If one passport requires a visa for a country but the other does not, choose the passport that allows visa-free entry. Apply for necessary visas well in advance through your country of **legal permanent residence** to avoid issues at the border.

### Entering and Exiting Based on Your Original Passport 
International immigration laws dictate you must enter and exit a country using the same passport. When traveling from Cambodia to South Korea as an example, your point of entry passport matters. If entering Cambodia on an Angolan passport, you must also exit Cambodia using that passport. The immigration officer at your departure country will reference your entry passport stamps and records. Keep the original entry passport handy to smoothly pass through exit controls.
### Using an Alternate Passport for the Next Destination
While you must always enter and exit the current country on the same passport, there is flexibility when traveling between countries. Upon exiting Cambodia, show the Angolan passport as required. However, when entering South Korea, you can present your alternate Guatemalan passport which may not require a South Korean visa. Just be sure any passports you intend to use have valid visas for all destinations and return travel. Carry both passports while transiting between countries in case of unexpected document checks.
### Flight Check-In and Boarding with Either Passport 
Most airline check-in counters and border control points will accept either valid passport for flight bookings, boarding passes and checking luggage. However, the passport must match the name on your booking and match what is presented to the destination immigration on arrival. During check-in, you can present either the Angolan or Guatemalan passport since both establish your identity and ticket reservations. Likewise, either passport can be used for boarding the outbound flight from Cambodia to South Korea.
### Entry Process Differences at South Korean Immigration
Upon arriving in South Korea, the passport presentation process differs from check-in. Here, immigration officers will reference passport information like nationality, visa status and admissibility. If entering on a Guatemalan passport that waives South Korean visa requirements, present only the Guatemalan passport for immigration clearance. Officials will want to see the passport belonging to the nationality seeking to legally enter their country. Keep the alternate Angolan passport stored away until exit from South Korea.
### Flexibility and Planning for Return Journeys
While traveling it's ideal to have options in case of emergencies or unexpected travel changes. On return to Cambodia for example, present the Angolan passport again as it was used for original entry. However, if the Angolan passport has since expired or you prefer using the Guatemalan, apply for a Cambodian visa in that passport before departing South Korea. With both passports and proper visas in order, some flexibility exists regarding which to present upon returns to Cambodia or other destinations when holding dual citizenship. Advance planning prevents issues by having the correct travel documents for any scenario.
### Conclusion
International travel with multiple passports requires awareness of document rules in each destination country. While some flexibility exists regarding which passport to use between locations, always enter and exit the current country on the same passport per their immigration laws. Apply for necessary visas in the appropriate passport and carry both travel documents when transiting internationally. With diligent preparation of visas and knowledge of passport presentation rules, dual citizens can smoothly navigate global immigration checkpoints. Adhering to these best practices leads to worry-free international mobility.
