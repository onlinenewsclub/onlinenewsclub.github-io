Living in a safe and livable neighborhood is one of the top priorities for many homeowners and renters in Manila. This guide surveys some of the neighborhoods that are considered relatively safer options in the metro.
## Ortigas Center and Surrounding Areas
Ortigas Center is one of the safest and most established commercial districts in the Manila metropolitan area. Located in Mandaluyong and Pasig, it has a variety of residential condominium and village developments within walking distance of amenities. **Ortigas Center residences** offer convenience of being near office buildings, malls, hospitals and schools in a gated community setup. 
San Antonio Village is a quiet neighborhood right beside Ortigas Center. Established in the 1960s, it has retained a suburban feel with tree-lined streets and tidy homes surrounded by walls. **San Antonio Village residences** provide an escape from the busy downtown atmosphere while being just a short drive away. 
Nearby Capitol Commons and Robinsons Triangle are two popular options for families. Both have amenities like clubhouses, swimming pools, playgrounds and walking paths within the community. Residents can easily access Ortigas Center or Greenhills for work or leisure without having to battle traffic on EDSA.
## Pasig's Prominent Communities
Santolan, located in the northeast part of Pasig, is among the most sought-after residential areas in the city. As one of Pasig's oldest and most established barangays, it has a variety of housing options from condominium towers to village homes. **Santolan Pasig residences** provide proximity to schools, restaurants, banks and parks within the community as well as accessibility to major thoroughfares.  
Another prominent Pasig neighborhood is the Forest Hills executive village in Ugong Norte. Established in the 1990s, Forest Hills and adjacent Valle Verde villages like Meridian, Huntington and Cambria offer a quiet suburban escape from the city within a gated compound. **Forest Hills residences** have amenities like a golf course, clubhouse, pools and jogging paths while being close to Ortigas Center and key Pasig destinations.
## High-Rise Living in Fort Bonifacio
For those seeking modern high-rise living in Metro Manila's premiere business district, Ayala Land's Grove and Rockwell developments in Fort Bonifacio offer prime options. Fort Bonifacio is known for its tree-lined avenues, lush open spaces, and mixed-use developments that integrate residential, commercial and leisure components. **The Grove and Rockwell residences** put residents in close proximity to Bonifacio Global City's office towers, malls, and expanding base of dining and entertainment options. Security is also stringent within these integrated communities.  
Filinvest's Sorrento Oasis, located along South Luzon Expressway, is another luxury high-rise cluster offering resort-style amenities. With facilities like an expansive pool, fitness center, function rooms and gardens, **Sorrento Oasis residences** provide a reprieve from the bustle of the city within the safe confines of the gated development. It is also near main thoroughfares for quick access around Metro Manila.
## Upscale Gated Subdivisions Beyond the CBDs 
For those preferring a more suburban living experience outside the main central business districts, new township developments like Nuvali in Santa Rosa, Laguna and Filinvest's Newtown in Pasig offer modern master-planned communities. Spread over large land areas, these integrated developments feature residential clusters, business parks, schools, activity centers, open spaces and resort-caliber amenities within gated security perimeters.
Nuvali has become one of the most popular new addresses beyond Metro Manila with its nature-inspired layout and facilities like a large lakefront promenade and recreational clubs. **Nuvali residences** offer expat-calibre amenities alongside easy access to Laguna's emerging corporate hubs. Meanwhile, Newtown's expansive open spaces and integration of lifestyle components within its self-contained, walkable setup has resonated well with urban professionals seeking a balance between work and play. **Newtown residences** provide a refreshing suburban option with proximity to Ortigas Center and key Pasig points of interest.
## Traditional Communities Holding Their Own
However, not all good neighborhoods in Metro Manila are new developments. Traditional communities like Loyola Heights in Quezon City which trace their origins back to the American colonial area still retain their charm as safe, walkable areas with older homes on tree-lined streets. Well-established barangays in Makati like South Forbes Park and Dasmari√±as Village also continue being desirable addresses despite being in more urban settings due to their prestige, central locations and sense of history.
In Pasig, older subdivisions nearer to the town center like Kapitolyo, Verdean and Santolan Proper have withstood development pressures to retain friendly, neighborly vibes within their leafy streets that are well-served by amenities, transport and infrastructure. Proximity to premium schools like La Salle Green Hills and Assumption also continue attracting homeowners here.
In summary, Metro Manila offers a variety of established and new neighborhood options differentiated along parameters of location, amenities, housing types and price points to suit different lifestyles. Prospective homeowners can carefully evaluate these factors in tandem with safety assessments to determine the community that best meets their needs. Ongoing improvements in infrastructure and urban planning also continuously enhance livability across the residential landscapes of the nation's capital region.
