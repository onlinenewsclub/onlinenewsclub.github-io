Guangzhou, also known as Canton, is located in southern China and has a unique linguistic landscape. As one of the most important economic hubs in China, it receives immigrants and expats from all over the country and world. However, the two main languages spoken in Guangzhou - Mandarin and Cantonese - can present a challenge for newcomers to navigate. This article examines the history and current state of both languages, and provides advice on which to learn first based on your goals and situation.
### The Dominance of [Cantonese Dialect](https://travelokie.github.io/resources/) 
Cantonese has traditionally been the primary language used among locals in Guangzhou and the surrounding Guangdong province. As descendants of immigrants from earlier eras, older generations in particular grew up speaking Cantonese as their mother tongue and may have limited ability in Mandarin. Even just twenty years ago in the early 1990s, **fluency in Cantonese** was essential to getting around the city and interacting with locals. The poetic sounds and lyrical style of Cantonese also influenced the development of Chinese pop music and added charm to the recitation of classical poems.

### The Rising Prominence of **Mandarin as the National Language**
In more recent decades, the Chinese government has undertaken a concerted effort to promote Mandarin nationwide as a lingua franca. This policy of "prompting Mandarin" has taken effect in Guangzhou as well, changing the linguistic dynamics considerably. Even many native Cantonese youth now fail to fully master their heritage language due to mandatory Mandarin instruction in schools. As a result, solely relying on Cantonese is no longer sufficient, and a working knowledge of Mandarin allows one to navigate daily life and do basic business transactions.
### Integrating into Local Community Favors **Learning Both Languages** 
While proficiency in Mandarin opens many doors initially, truly immersing oneself in Guangzhou's culture suggests tackling Cantonese as well. During festive periods like Chinese New Year when migrant workers return home, the local community reverts predominantly to their mother tongue. Locals also remain very welcoming to foreigners making an effort to learn Cantonese. Having basic familiarity with both languages cultivates deeper connections and a richer experience living in Guangzhou long-term. For expats pursuing long-term careers in the vibrant business scene as well, competence in Cantonese and Mandarin represents a major asset.
### Prioritizing Language Learning Based on Goals and Timeline  
For short-term visitors just passing through Guangzhou, Mandarin provides a solid foundation for basic functions and interactions during their stay. However, those planning to settle in the region for years should devote initial energy to Mandarin but with the goal of adding Cantonese studies later. International companies recruiting employees for Guangzhou positions increasingly seek bilingual staff, prioritizing candidates fluent in both over Mandarin alone. With patience and persistent practice, learning the tonal intricacies of Cantonese proves very rewarding for long-term cultural assimilation. Choosing a language learning path requires evaluating one's objectives and timeline in Guangzhou.
### Embracing Guangzhou's Rich Linguistic Heritage
While the prominence of Cantonese may be diminishing in the face of nationwide Mandarin promotion, efforts to pass on the unique dialect continue. Local organizations offer Cantonese classes to help revive enthusiasts' interest. Exposing oneself to the mellifluous tones of Cantonese pop songs from the 80s and 90s also offers an entry point to appreciate the musicality of the language. Overall, both Mandarin and Cantonese each offer valuable avenues for exploring Guangzhou's dynamic present while connecting to the historic roots of one of China's most internationalized metropolises. With an open and adaptive approach, language learners can reap rich rewards from Guangzhou's multilingual cultural offerings.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, Guangzhou presents a complex yet fascinating linguistic landscape for those keen to immerse themselves in the local culture. While Mandarin stands as the practical gateway language, devotees who persevere with Cantonese will uncover deeper layers of social integration and cultural appreciation. With patience and an adaptive approachprioritizing Mandarin first followed by additions of Cantonese over the long run, expats can maximize their experiences in this pivotal commercial hub of southern China. Above all, maintaining an open and enthusiastic attitude towards both of Guangzhou's abundant linguistic resources will best serve newcomers settling into life in this historic port city.
