## Things To Know Before Arriving
As with any international trip, there are a few essential things you'll want to be prepared with before arriving in Lima, Peru. 
### Have The Right Documentation
Make sure to always have your valid [passport and visa documents](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-uc778-ub3c4-uc778-uc774-ud30c-ud0a4-uc2a4-ud0c4-uc744-ubc29-ubb38-ud558-ub294-uac83-uc5d0-ub300-ud55c-uacbd-ud5d8/) readily available during your stay. The authorities may ask to see these at any time, such as when entering attractions or using transportation services. Photocopies are generally not accepted, so keep the original documents on your person.

### Familiarize Yourself With The Currency
Another crucial step is getting acquainted with **Peru's currency, the Sol**. Figure out how you will access local funds, such as through ATM withdrawals or cash exchanges at the airport. Bringing a mix of both cash and ATM/debit cards provides flexibility. Keep in mind how conversion rates work and any transaction fees from your bank. 
### Create A Realistic Budget
When budgeting for your trip, consider averaging at least $50 USD per day as a starting point. Exact costs will vary depending on your planned activities and spending habits. Be sure to allocate money towards accommodations, meals, transportation, attractions and entertainment. Leave room for unexpected expenses as well to avoid going over budget during your trip.
## Where To Stay In Lima
As the capital city, Lima offers various neighborhoods and districts suitable for visitors to stay in. Here are a few top options to consider:
### Miraflores - A Prime Location 
This upscale area along the coast is renowned for its **safety, amenities and proximity to attractions**. With its lively atmosphere, many restaurants, cafes and shops, Miraflores ranks among the most popular tourist destinations in Lima. Proximity to the Larcomar mall and parks also makes it ideal for sightseeing on foot.
### Downtown Lima - Visit During The Day
The historical center boasts impressive Spanish colonial architecture and cultural sites. However, it is not recommended lingering after dark as **safety standards decrease at night**. Staying here allows close access to key landmarks like the main Plaza de Armas. But opt for early morning or daytime visits from another neighborhood.
### San Isidro - Quiet Luxury
known as Lima's financial district, San Isidro provides an elegant yet relaxed ambiance. It caters more to international corporations with upscale high-rise developments and gated communities. The peace and quiet make it ideal for travellers seeking **comfortable long-term accommodations**. However, transportation into other areas may be needed. 
## Top Things To Do
With a wealth of attractions showcasing Peru's rich heritage and natural beauty, Lima offers plenty to keep visitors engaged. Here are some must-see options:
### Visit The Magical Fountains Circuit
Don't miss the spectacular water, music and light show at **Circuito Magico del Agua** located within a vast urban park. Three daily performances feature over a dozen elaborate fountains synchronised to different songs. It's a fun family-friendly activity especially in the evenings.
### Explore Downtown Colonial Architecture
Wander the cobbled streets surrounding the resplendent main square known as Plaza de Armas. Admire historic structures like the Government Palace and Cathedral, which also houses **famous Catacombs**. Nearby points of interest include the archaeological Museum and Chocolate Museum. 
### Shop At Larcomar Mall
Conveniently located along the Pacific coastline, this modern multi-level complex houses upscale boutiques, dining options with ocean views and a small mini theme park. Walk along the **scenic oceanfront promenade** and people watch. It's a top place for souvenir shopping and leisure activities.
### Try Peruvian Cuisine
No visit is complete without sampling Peru's acclaimed diverse food scene. Highly recommended dishes to try include Anticuchos (beef heart skewers), Ceviche (citrus marinated raw fish), and causas (potato-filled turnovers). Be sure to dine at well-rated local eateries rather than fast food chains for authentic fare. 
## Getting Around Lima 
Transportation logistics are essential to smoothly navigate the city each day. Some recommended options include:
### Use Ride-Hailing Apps
Apps like Uber, Beat and InDriver provide safe, affordable rides around town. Prices are set upfront avoiding haggling or guesswork. They also allow tracking the driver's location live for peace of mind. 
### Take Taxis Within Districts
Short trips within neighborhoods can be done by regular taxi with meters. But negotiate fares in advance for longer routes to bypass meter tampering. Be wary of taxi drivers trying to overcharge foreigners unfamiliar with rates. 
### Utilize The Metro 
While still limited, the metro system is continually expanding to new lines. It's an efficient way to travel between popular zones like Central Lima to Miraflores during daytime hours. Stations are clearly signed making navigation straightforward. 
### Rent bicycles or e-scooters
Green alternatives are emerging for exploring scenic coastal paths and parks at a leisurely pace. Look for daily or hourly rental options near main tourist areas. Helmets are required by law for safety.
## Safety Tips To Follow
Finally, taking necessary precautions helps ensure an incident-free visit:
- Only carry required cash, cards and ID in secured pockets or bags while out 
- Avoid isolating yourself in unpopulated streets, especially at night
- Be wary of strangers initiating conversation to potentially distract and rob 
- Pickpocketing is common in crowded spaces so keep valuables zipped up
- Use official licensed taxis from trusted apps rather than those touting for custom on the street
- Only withdraw cash outdoors during the day from reliable ATM locations 
By doing proper research, budgeting appropriately and following basic safety rules, travellers can thoroughly enjoy all the unique cultural experiences Peru's capital Lima has to offer. Proper planning takes the uncertainty out of exploring a new international destination.
