This scenic urban trail passes historic neighborhoods and parks along the Trinity River. Bike for a few hours before fueling up for your day ahead. Next, head to **the original Neiman Marcus flagship store** to experience high-end shopping in its iconic downtown location. Be sure to stop for lunch at **the Zodiac Room cafe** inside for classic Texan cuisine. 
After browsing the store, take the **DART light rail** west to Oak Cliff. Your destination? **The Spiral Diner** for an all-American breakfast. This retro diner is beloved by locals for its hearty dishes made from scratch. Once you've eaten, continue on the light rail to Deep Ellum, Dallas' arts district. Spend the afternoon wandering **the shops, galleries and street art** scattered throughout the neighborhood. 
In the late afternoon, return to downtown on the light rail. Visit the impressive collection at the **Dallas Museum of Art** which houses works from around the world. As the sun starts to set, make your way to **Reunion Tower** to witness the city lights up from high above. Take in the panoramic views from the outdoor deck before heading to nearby **Belmont Hotel** to book a room for the night. 
After settling in, head over to **Deep Ellum** again. Catch some live music at a local venue like **The Belmont** or **Club Dada**. The area really comes alive at night - enjoy the hip neighborhood atmosphere.
