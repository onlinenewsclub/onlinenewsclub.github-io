### Signs of a Different Culture
China is vastly different from western cultures in many ways. Simple things like manners can seem strange without understanding the cultural context. While loudness and some behaviors may appear rude to western eyes, it is how Chinese people conduct themselves normally. When visiting another country, an open and understanding mindset is important for appreciating unique aspects of their way of life.
Travel provides opportunities to see beyond surface level differences and gain new perspectives. During a stay in China, one learns the customs are dissimilar but the people are generally friendly. Rural towns maintained traditional ways of living while modern cities amazed with rapid development. Both hinted at a rich and evolving national character worth experiencing firsthand.

### A Bustling Metropolis Raises Expectations 
Shanghai amazed with [futuristic infrastructure](https://thetopnews.github.io/page2/) and a thriving international community. In 1998, walking through the gleaming skyscrapers and well-kept parks, it was hard to believe this pace of modernization. The standard of living seemed on par with global financial hubs. 
Public transport ran with precision even during rush hour. Well-lit pedestrian walkways spanned for miles with shops decorated to international standards. High-speed internet was available almost everywhere. It was no wonder property prices soared to match leading global cities. 
Yet beneath the sparkling veneer lay a gritty past. Old neighborhoods held character in narrow alleys and traditional shops. A new generation embraced progress while honoring ancestral roots in family-run businesses and temples. Shanghai balanced heritage with aspirations, retaining local flavor amidst worldwide influences.
### Culinary Exploration Reveals Daily Life
During an internship in Xi'an, cafeteria meals offered a chance to experience typical student fare. One **popular noodle stall** stood out for its familiar Singaporean dishes. Eating there daily formed a routine until an unpleasant discovery changed habits. 
Seeing the chef relieving himself without basic hygiene was shocking. Many developing nations still face sanitation issues but maintaining clean practices is a minimum standard everywhere. Unfortunately, lack of oversight and education contributes to public health risks. While not necessarily representative of the local culture, such lapses do occur.
Curiosity to try local flavors must consider safety and responsibility. Small eateries often prioritize throughput over standards. Being an informed global citizen means choosing vendors carefully to avoid harm and support better practices. Overall, the internship exposed a side of university life not seen through a tourist lens.
### Unexpected Voyages of the Body
Public transit provides a window into daily human drama. One memorable train ride contained an unintentional comedy of errors. A sleeping passenger had an unwelcome awakening thanks to the mucus of a coughing stranger. 
Not realizing what transpired, she ingested the errant expectorate thinking it came from her. Ironically, bystanders spare others such displays but cannot always control bodily functions. While unhygienic and unlucky, it reflects our shared biology overrides social norms in rare moments. 
My sister felt sorry yet amused by the absurd chain of events. No harm befell the unsuspecting lady in the end. As with any major city, minor mishaps due to proximity are an unavoidable quirk of crowded transport. The incident lives on as a lighthearted tale, a reminder that humor can be found even in uncomfortable situations.
### Rural Life Showed Resilience of Communities 
Visiting Zhangjiajie, despite the tourist development, rural areas maintained old-fashioned charm. Farmhouses dotted mountainsides like scenes from Wuxia novels. Fields patched crags where terraced plots defied gravity. 
Strong-willed villagers eked livings from inhospitable terrain with remarkable ingenuity. Kinship and **traditional values** underpinned tight-knit hamlets. Generations inherited sustainable practices preserving landscapes and heritage. Basic infrastructure arrived lately yet residents embraced modernization pragmatically without losing roots.
Zhangjiajie displayed the persevering rural spirit across China. Isolated towns withstood challenges through self-sufficiency and cooperation. Outsiders glimpsed resilient foundations supporting national rejuvenation from countryside to cities. Their perseverance ensured cultural continuity alongside advances shaping China's promising future.
### Fond Memories of a Vast Land
Travel opened my eyes to China's diverse attractions. Shanghai amazed as a global titan while Xi'an and Zhangjiajie showed humble hometown charms. Friendly locals warmly welcomed strangers to share their lives and customs. 
China's scale, history and progress left me in awe. I returned with deep respect for its industrious citizens and optimism and their emerging standing. While adjustments took getting used to, open-mindedness enriched experiences. Memories of this fascinating nation still inspire my exploration of foreign cultures with care, curiosity and gratitude. My journey only touched the surface - I hope to rediscover more of China's wonders in the years to come.
