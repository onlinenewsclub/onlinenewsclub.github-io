### Income and Savings
The average after-tax income in Riyadh allows residents to cover living expenses for 1.8 months compared to just 0.3 months in Tehran, indicating higher wages and savings potential in Saudi Arabia. A higher-paying job could thus offer better financial security and standard of living over the long run in Riyadh versus Tehran.
### Social Freedoms and Lifestyle
Under **Saudi social reforms longtail-keyword,** Riyadh has seen a dramatic transformation with relaxed gender segregation rules and religious policing. Women have gained equal rights like driving, and modest Western attire is now accepted. In contrast, Tehran still enforces conservative dress codes and restrictions on women. Daily life, entertainment options and social interactions are far less restricted in the more liberal atmosphere of Riyadh today. 
### Job Market and Opportunities  
With Saudi Vision 2030 aiming to diversify the economy and **Iran economic sanctions longtail-keyword** hurting Iran, job opportunities abound across sectors in Riyadh. International businesses are increasingly setting up regional headquarters in the thriving Saudi capital. However, Tehran presents limited private industry compared to the large state sector and struggle with international isolation. High-paying professionals thus have a wider range of career choices in Riyadh overall.
### Tourism and Infrastructure
Riyadh has become a growing tourist destination with new attractions, events, restaurants and infrastructure developed under Vision 2030. On the other hand, tourism remains limited in Tehran due to ongoing geopolitical issues. Visitors will find Riyadh to be a more **modern urban infrastructure longtail-keyword** with better connectivity and global exposure through business and leisure travel compared to Tehran today.
### Quality of Life for Families
Riyadh scores higher on quality of life indices, housing quality, healthcare access and family-friendly environment. The transformation of Saudi society has made Riyadh a preferred destination for families from across the world. However, conservative social values still prevail to an extent in Tehran, which could be less attractive for relocation with kids and spouses. Overall work-life balance tends to be better in the vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere of modern Riyadh.
In summary, **while Tehran remains affordable for basic needs, Riyadh presents a more comprehensive value proposition for career growth and quality living over the long run due to its economic vibrancy, social reforms and modern infrastructure under Vision 2030.** However, budget-conscious individuals focused only on short-term costs may still consider Tehran as a relatively inexpensive option with acceptable lifestyle. The best choice ultimately depends on one's priorities, budget, job prospects and acceptance of cultural differences between the two cities.
