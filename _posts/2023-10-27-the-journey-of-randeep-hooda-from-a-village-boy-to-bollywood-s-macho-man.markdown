### Early Life and Struggles
Born in a small village called Daseya in Haryana, Randeep Hooda had humble beginnings. [His father was a surgeon](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-27-voyage-xe0-madagascar-l-xeele-de-la-biodiversit-xe9-unique/) and his mother Asha Hooda is a BJP politician. He did his schooling from Delhi Public School and then moved to Australia for higher studies where he earned a **Bachelors degree in Marketing & Human Resource Management**. Getting his first role in Monsoon Wedding was challenging for Randeep as he had to rely on his **Australian accent** rather than his acting skills. Even after an impressive performance, it took him 4 long years to get his next project.

### Breakthrough with D (2005)
In 2005, director Ram Gopal Varma gave Randeep his big break by casting him in the lead role of gangster film 'D'. **Portraying the real life of Dawood Ibrahim**, the film became a turning point and gave Randeep nationwide recognition.
