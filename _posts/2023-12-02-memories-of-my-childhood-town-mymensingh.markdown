Mymensingh, a historic town located in northern Bangladesh, holds many precious memories from my childhood. Growing up in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I witnessed the townprogress and modernize over time, yet retain its centuries-old charm. Let me take you through some of the highlights that made Mymensingh so special.
### [A Quiet Rural Setting](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-11-25-top-sights-and-activities-for-luxembourg-tourists/) 
When I was young in the 1960s, Mymensingh had a quiet, rural atmosphere compared to the bustling city it is today. The town was less crowded with many green, open spaces. Our neighborhood had a tight-knit community where children could play safely on the streets. Life moved at a slower pace. As the largest district in Bangladesh at the time, Mymensingh had a **bucolic small-town appeal** that allowed residents to enjoy a high quality of life.

### **Development of Educational Institutions**
One of the things I'm most proud of about Mymensingh is that it established many "**firsts**" for higher education in Bangladesh. It was home to the country's first Agricultural University, providing an important foundation for the nation's farming industry. The **prestigious Girls Cadet College** and National Academy for Primary Education also called Mymensingh home, cultivating young minds. These institutions helped Mymensingh gain a strong reputation for its commitment to learning.
### **Recreation Along the Brahmaputra River** 
A cherished pastime was spending afternoons on the banks of the majestic Brahmaputra River. Families would have picnics and the younger crowd would socialize. It was always lively to see residents from neighboring districts come to Mymensingh to unwind on the riverfront. The soothing waters created a picturesque scene and a sense of calm. Spending time on the Brahmaputra is one of my fondest **childhood riverbank memories** in Mymensingh.
### **A Hub of Commerce and Services**
Even back then, Mymensingh served as an important commercial and medical center for the surrounding regions. People relied on its bustling markets for daily necessities and specialized shops. The town's hospitals also played a critical role in **healthcare services delivery** beyond city limits. It had all the **amenities of a subdivisional headquarters** to support a large catchment area. This unique dynamic is what gave Mymensingh its historic stature and helped it thrive for centuries.
### **Memories of Rural Life** 
I have very fond recollections of spending holidays and weekends in our village of Bhabokhali, just a short ride from Mymensingh. Life was much simpler - we would help with farming, explore nature, and bond with extended family. Some of my happiest childhood moments were spent in the village, disconnected from city life. The scenes of rice fields, orchards and the railway line passing nearby are forever etched in my mind. I'll always cherish those **rustic village vacation memories** from decades ago.
### **Evolving Infrastructure and Modern Amenities**  
During a return visit in the 2010s, I was impressed to see how well Mymensingh had developed new roads and communication links over the years. The four-lane highways connecting it to Dhaka have undeniably boosted economic and recreational activities. As the newest divisional headquarters, I'm certain the region will embrace even more infrastructure upgrades and **state-of-the-art urban amenities**. These positive changes showcase how Bangladesh is making steady progress across all sectors.
### **Enduring ties to My Childhood Roots**
Revisiting places from my past was both joyous and bittersweet. While certain landmarks changed beyond recognition, the kindness of relatives and traits of the local populace felt familiar. Mymensingh will always hold a special place in my heart for representing simpler, happier times. I hope future generations can appreciate its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty. This historic town shaped my early years and instilled a lifelong connection to my **Bangladeshi hometown roots**.
