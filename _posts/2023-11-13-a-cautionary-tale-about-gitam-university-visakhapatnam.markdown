### The Hidden Costs of Attending GITAM
While GITAM University markets itself as a top tier institution, there are many hidden costs students and their families often do not realize until they are already enrolled. Tuition alone is upwards of 2.25 lakh rupees per year, not including additional expenses for hostels, meals, and other student fees that can easily push the total annual cost above 4 lakh rupees. For many middle class families, this represents an enormous financial burden that they struggle to afford year after year. 
However, there seems to be little tangible value or return on such a large monetary investment according to several former students. Classmates report widespread allegations of [nepotism and unfair grading practices](https://notiziedioggi.github.io/tags/) that disadvantage meritocratic students while enabling less qualified peers to pass exams through questionable means. The administration also seems overly fixated on collecting fees rather than focusing on quality education or student outcomes. Overall, GITAM may not be worth the high **financial and emotional cost** for average students hoping to get a decent job placement after graduation.

### Concerns about GITAM's Academic Standards and Grading Policies 
Numerous troubling anecdotes indicate serious issues with GITAM's academic standards and treatment of students. Hard working students who study diligently report unexpectedly failing subjects they knew well, only to pass after paying expensive re-evaluation fees. In contrast, lackadaisical classmates who put in little effort are said to magically pass consistently without understanding the material. The experiences of the author's sister, a top student, and friend, an "nerd" who never failed before, raise serious red flags about **fairness and transparency in GITAM's grading**. 
Students also complain about **inadequate learning facilities** like poor ventilation from rarely turned on air conditioners that hinder their studies. With the current pricing, one would expect a dedicated learning environment on par with private international schools. Unfortunately, subpar academics and infrastructure undermine the value of a GITAM degree, leaving graduates at a disadvantage in the job market.
### Difficulties in Career Prospects after Graduating from GITAM
A recurring theme highlighted in reviews is the lack of reputed company recruiters at GITAM's placement cell. While a small number of students may get placed in analytics or IT firms, opportunities tend to be limited for the **vast majority of graduates across different fields**. Those pursuing science-related degrees face even dimmer career prospects with almost no industrial exposure during their studies. 
Once the initial campus recruiting season ends, many graduates struggle significantly to find suitable white-collar roles matching their qualifications, let alone startups in their selected domains of study. The inherent **lack of employability skills and career counseling** severely hampers alumni success over the long run. Even those who manage low level jobs often find it challenging to switch roles or get promoted due to the mediocre brand cachet of their alma mater on resumes.
### Nepotism, Favoritism and Lack of Transparency are Rampant 
Insider accounts repeatedly point to the prevalence of nepotism, favoritism and lack of transparency which undermine meritocracy at GITAM. An anonymously shared story involved the **HOD of a biotech department unfairly targeting and failing a deserving student** to help pass a relative with poorer academic credentials instead. Such malpractices call into question the integrity and impartiality of faculty and management when important decisions on student grades and scholarships are taken behind closed doors.
The consequences destroy hope and faith in the system for many aspirational students who joined the university hoping to get a quality education through dint of hard work alone. The administration has seemingly turned a blind eye to addressing the roots of such persistent complaints for many years now. Unless serious reforms are instituted to create accountability and fairness, GITAM will continue to risk harming the career prospects of students who unwittingly enroll there.
### Investing in Oneself through Alternative Options
In summary, the exorbitant fees charged by GITAM seem incredibly hard to justify given the multitude of issues raised around their questionable academic standards, lack of transparency and limited career outcomes. Students and parents would be better served exploring more reasonably priced local government colleges or investigating scholarships for reputed deemed universities, professional colleges and international universities that offer a more promising long term return on their educational investment. 
Rather than relying on any single institution, the onus is on each learner to proactively develop in-demand skills, participate in internships, networking events and mentorship programs that will help them stand out regardless of their alma mater. With dedication and determination, **one has the power to build a successful future through alternative means** besides a questionable university like GITAM.
