### Staying Street-Smart 
Casablanca is a generally safe city, but as in any urban destination, it pays to be cautious. [Keep your valuables out of sight](https://thetopnews.github.io/the-best-mods-for-skyrim-special-edition-on-ps4-to-enhance-your-gaming-experience/) - don't show off money, phones or laptops unnecessarily in public places. Pickpocketing can be an issue, so hold bags closely and don't leave anything unattended. After dark, try to **avoid empty streets and sketchy neighborhoods**. Locals know which areas have higher crime rates, so ask a trusted contact for guidance. 
If using your phone in public, be discreet. Opt for **brief calls and texting with earbuds in**, rather than having devices exposed. Robbery is a concern, so stash electronics whenever possible. Walking alone late at night also increases risk, so plan accordingly or take taxis for late returns. Overall though, Moroccans are quite welcoming - maintain street smarts without living in fear.

### Respecting Local Customs and Traditions
When visiting a new country, it's important to respect local culture and norms. In Morocco, observe modest dress standards - **loose, conservative clothing is expected especially for women**. During Ramadan, avoid eating or drinking in front of others out of respect for those fasting. Try to **greet people with "Salam Aleykum"** and be polite in interactions. 
Moroccans welcome tourists but may take offense to disrespectful behavior. Learn some key Arabic phrases to put locals at ease. Inviting locals to share their culture and getting to know them personally helps integrate smoothly. Always say please ("Min fadlek") and thank you ("Shokran") when receiving assistance. Small courtesies go a long way in building goodwill with residents.
### Staying Safe in Public Spaces 
Casablanca's bustling medina quarter, parks and busy streets can feel overwhelming at first. Keep handbags closed and don't flash cash or belongings. When exploring markets, stay alert for pickpockets in crowded areas. Stick to **main thoroughfares rather than back alleys** after dark for safety. 
Be wary of strangers directly asking for money as some may be scams. If approached, politely decline to discuss personal matters. Anyone offering "free tours" or special deals may expect cash rewards, so use discretion. When paying for services like parking, have the **exact amount readily available** to avoid disputes. Respect parking regulations to steer clear of trouble.
### Protecting Money and Documents
Photocopy important IDs, cards and travel documents as a backup in case of loss or theft. Never carry the originals of passports or papers unless absolutely necessary. Distribute some cash, a debit card and main credit card between compartments of your money belt or bags for security. Keep a separate emergency stash of small bills on your person.
When using ATMs, choose machines inside banks rather than standalone units. Be vigilant of card skimming devices or people shoulder surfing PINs. Exercise caution conversing about travel plans or displaying expensive tech products openly. For large purchases, pay with traceable credit cards rather than cash. Maintain receipts in case items need returning. Ensure accommodation and transportation have been pre-paid to avoid scams. 
### Getting Around Casablanca Safely
Casablanca's metro, trains and buses provide efficient public transportation. Visit official sites to study maps and schedules beforehand. During rush hours, be wary of pickpockets in crowded stations and carriages. Opt for **front-facing seats near the conductor** when possible. 
Take recommended taxis from reliable stands at major landmarks. Verify the cab is properly registered before getting in. Ask for the meter to be engaged ("Digi le taxim√®tre") to avoid overcharging. Confirm the fare displayed matches the ride length and route. At night, use the taxi hailing apps Careem or Uber for extra security verification of drivers. 
Drivers may also offer sightseeing tours - get clear rates and itineraries agreed on in advance. Obtain trusted local recommendations for car rental companies if self-driving. Always lock vehicles and don't leave valuables visible when parked. Insist on seatbelts despite cultural norms, as road safety laws apply to visitors.
### Handling Emergency Situations 
Remain calm if confronted by aggressive behavior and don't resist any thieves. Call the police immediately on 194 in emergencies. Consider installing a global roaming app with SOS alerts too. In a medical crisis, contact private clinics of the major international insurance providers or flag down nearby police for help reaching hospitals. 
Make photocopies of travel documents including flight itineraries, keep emergency contacts handy, and make travel partners aware of plans. Store copies of info in online drives as well as physically with you. If lost, contact your embassy and file police reports promptly. Having the proper insurance, vaccines and taking basic precautions provides peace of mind for adventuring safely in Casablanca.
