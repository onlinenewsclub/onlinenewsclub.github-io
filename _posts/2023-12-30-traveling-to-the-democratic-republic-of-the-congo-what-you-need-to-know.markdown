### The Current Security and Infrastructure Situation 
The DRC is a vast and beautiful country, however traveling there requires careful planning due to ongoing security issues and poor infrastructure in many areas. **While parts of major cities like Kinshasa, Bukavu and Lubumbashi are reasonably safe**, remote and rural regions can be dangerous due to the activities of rebel militias. Visitors should monitor the current security advisories from their government and only travel with an experienced local guide. The condition of roads outside cities remains very challenging, with many unpaved sections. Air travel within the DRC relies on smaller aircraft that are not certified for international flights. Travelers need to be prepared for basic conditions and potential lengthy overland journeys if venturing far from border towns.
