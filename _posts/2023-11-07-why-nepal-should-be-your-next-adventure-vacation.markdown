Nepal is home to some of South Asia's finest temples, pagodas, and monasteries. Exquisitely detailed wooden carvings, vivid paintings, and elaborate religious ceremonies take place inside enduring structures. Top sights include UNESCO World Heritage sites like Kathmandu's Durbar Square featuring ornate Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas.

### **Vibrant Festivals**  
Throughout the year, colorful festivals celebrate Nepal's diverse cultural heritage and bring communities together. Whether it's Tihar, the "festival of lights", or Bhota Yatra paying homage to Hindu deities, displays of music, dance, rituals and feasts enliven streets. Holi is a joyous spring celebration where crowds toss vibrant powders leaving everyone coated in a rainbow of hues. During Dashain, thousands flock to honor the goddess Durga.

The Nepali kindness leaves lasting impressions and is a highlight of any trip. 
### **Lifelong Friendships**  
A natural charisma and curiosity about the outside world makes Nepalis easy to bond with. Conversations flow freely as new friends are made over meals, on adventures, or just strolling city streets. Temporary visitors sometimes become permanent, unable to resist the pull of the people as much as the places. Lifelong friendship networks of global citizens are formed, exchanging visits between Nepal and abroad for years. The special bonds ignite a desire to return time and again to this hospitable Himalayan nation.
