During one semester break, I decided to visit home along with some friends. Our train to Hyderabad was packed with students returning home due to some exams. We somehow squeezed in and managed to stand holding onto rails and poles for support. Reaching Hyderabad station came as a relief after that tiring train ride. 
### A Rush to Catch the Train 
After spending a night in Hyderabad, I rushed to catch my early morning train home. Thanks to my hurried breakfast and packing, I comfortably settled in my reserved [upper berth](https://thetopnews.github.io/tips-and-techniques-for-beginner-oil-painters/) and slept through most of the journey resting my tired body.

### An Unforeseen Delay  
Waking up starving in the evening, I faced an issue as my train was running late and the pantry services weren't available then. With no food joints around at the station stop, I had a tough time getting something to eat due to the crowd. But I was lucky to find some **hot snacks** to end my hungry state before catching my train again.
### A Careless Mistake
While returning to the moving train after eating, a grave error happened. As the doors closed behind me, I desperately knocked and yelled for help. Clinging onto the window for life, I thought this was going to be my last journey. Luckily an elderly man noticed my plight and **saved my life** by pulling me back inside safely. It was a close shave that taught me an important lesson.
### An Uneasy Feeling 
During one of my overnight train journeys with a friend, I sensed something wrong with the man staring at me from the neighboring berth. My instincts were right when he attempted inappropriate physical contact twice. My forceful retaliation ensured my safety for the rest of the journey. However, such **unsafe occurrences** left me on edge throughout the night.
### A Stranger's Kind Gesture  
During my college return journey, I faced a medical issue and was running a high fever. A kind gentleman in my compartment noticed my condition and insisted on fetching me water and medicines from the pantry car. His act of **compassion for a stranger** is something I will always remember fondly even today.
### Learning from Experiences
These are some of the unforgettable experiences from my student days of train traveling. While not all journeys were smooth, such incidents enhanced my survival skills and awareness. I also realized the importance of safety precautions, following instincts and seeking help from co-passengers when in need. My train travels back then equipped me with many life lessons on facing uncertainties with determination.
