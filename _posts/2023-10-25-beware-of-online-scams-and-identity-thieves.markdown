### Beware of False Funding Requests 
A major red flag in the story was the scammer asking for **money to buy gift cards for his "daughters"**. Fraudsters commonly request targetted gift cards, wiring money or cryptocurrency because thesecannot be traced or reversed once sent. No legitimate person would demand these untraceable payment methods. **Stay alert of improbable funding explanations that do not make logical sense or lack credibility**. Do not let sympathy override rational thinking when being manipulated.
### Confirm Claims Before Assisting Anyone

Criminals thrive off victims' willingness to take stories at face value without verification. **Always research details provided to confirm legitimacy before assisting**. Simple fact checking, like examining whether a place exists, can reveal inconsistencies. Maintain a healthy dose of skepticism and demand verifiable proof like IDs, contact details or video calls to confirm identities before engaging further.

Records or files could also contain metadata with location data tags at odds with a person's claims. Be a detectives—take time to scrutinize information for any anomalies suggesting dishonesty. Your due diligence protects you from manipulative tricks and helps bring scammers to justice.
