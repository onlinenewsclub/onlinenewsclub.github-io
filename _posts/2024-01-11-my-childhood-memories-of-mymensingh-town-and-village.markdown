### Rediscovering My Roots 
I was born in the town of [Mymensingh](https://thetopnews.github.io/top-debit-cards-for-playstation-network-psn-purchases-in-2022/), located in northern Bangladesh, over 40 years ago. As a child, **Mymensingh** held a special place in my heart as it was filled with wonderful memories. Recently, I had the opportunity to return to **Mymensingh** with my family to rediscover where I came from. Visiting the places from my childhood ignited nostalgia and unearthed long-buried recollections.   
While **Mymensingh** town had transformed significantly over the decades, expanding rapidly due to population growth and urbanization, certain aspects remained unchanged. People still conversed in a friendly, peaceful manner on the streets. Street food vendors attracted crowds as the tantalizing scents filled the air. Nearby districts continued to rely on **Mymensingh’s** hospitals and facilities for critical needs. Seeing familiar scenes delighted me while modern additions like new highways impressed my family. Overall, **Mymensingh** had progressed tremendously but retained its quintessential character.

### A Childhood Home Left Behind
We then searched for my family's old residence in **Mymensingh** town. With difficulty, I identified the large house from my younger days which was now a diabetes center. Disappointingly, we could not enter to see inside. Next, we journeyed to my birth village of **Bhabokhali**, located only 8 kilometers from **Mymensingh** town near the **Brahmaputra River**. Amazingly, parts of the village house where my grandparents and uncles lived still stood intact despite 57 years passing. Meeting distant relatives living there today filled me with joy and a sense of belonging. 
### A River Running Dry
One major change shocked me deeply - the **Brahmaputra River** beside my village, full of water in my memories, had almost entirely dried up. I had not anticipated such a disheartening sight. The river played a significant role in village life and my childhood recollections involved riverbank activities. Seeing it so parched dredged up complicated emotions. I realized how climate change and other environmental pressures had severely impacted the region. Witnessing the river's decline stirred profound sadness within me and my family members consoled me in my tears. The river's current state underscored harsh realities about environmental degradation.
### Treasured Moments in School  
During my time growing up in **Mymensingh**, I attended two notable schools which held fond recollections. From ages 6 to 8, I was a pupil at **Radhasundori Girls' School**, located centrally in **Mymensingh** town. I remember the red-brick building and playing regularly with friends in its courtyard. Later, I transferred to **Mrityunjoy School** opposite **Radhasundori School** where my maternal uncles studied. More vivid school recollections involved lunchtime gatherings, competitions and caring teachers who imparted values and knowledge. Revisiting these historic educational institutions stirred nostalgia and pride in being part of their rich legacies.
### A Thriving Educational Hub
**Mymensingh** established several 'firsts' in Bangladesh, cementing its reputation as an educational pioneer. It was rewarding to see these institutions thriving today. We toured the expansive campus of **Bangladesh Agricultural University**, founded in 1961 as the nation's premier farm degrees provider. Nearby stood the prestigious **Mymensingh Girls Cadet College**, established in 1994 as Bangladesh's first female cadet institute. Both have proudly trained countless future leaders through quality teaching. Witnessing their impressive growth and influence reaffirmed **Mymensingh's** steadfast commitment to molding minds and driving progress across sectors.
### Bountiful Natural Beauty   
Our travels uncovered **Mymensingh's** magnificent natural attractions adding to its allure. We visited the picturesque **Tanguar Haor**, part of the largest wetland in Bangladesh and habitat for diverse flora and fauna. Boating on its azure waters amid greenery refreshed our souls. We also hiked through the scenic **Madhupur Sal Forest**, home to rare plants and Bengal tigers. Its dense woodlands whisked me back to childhood nature exploration. **Mymensingh's** idyllic countryside, dotted with hills, marshes and foliage, beautifully complement modern developments in the district. Its bountiful natural offerings strengthen **Mymensingh's** standing as a prime outdoor destination.
### Treasured Connections Rekindled 
Revisiting cherished spots from my early days in **Mymensingh** reestablished profound bonds to my history. Interacting with kindly villagers and distant kin reinforced a deep-rooted sense of community. Witnessing **Mymensingh's** impressive advances while retaining its heartwarming essence filling me with hometown pride. Sharing nostalgic tales with interested family deepened our mutual understanding. Bidding farewell to **Mymensingh**, I felt immensely grateful for the opportunity to rediscover its significance in shaping my identity. Its influence will always remain etched in my soul. Most importantly, **Mymensingh** reminded me of the importance of cherishing one’s roots.
