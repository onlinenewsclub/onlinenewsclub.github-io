### Getting to Know the City
Nairobi is the vibrant capital city of Kenya, located in the central highlands on the southern side of the country. Home to over 4 million residents, it is truly a melting pot where people from different ethnic groups in Kenya come together in fellowship. As a visitor to Nairobi, here are some key things you should know about the city to help you get acquainted and make the most of your trip.
The city has a temperate climate year-round due to its proximity to the equator. Average temperatures range from 15 to 28 degrees Celsius. Light clothing such as jeans, shirts, and sweaters are suitable for most of the year. Rainfall is moderate with both short and long rains seasons. Local supermarkets and convenience stores are well-stocked if you need supplies. Major international [chains like Nakumatt](https://travelokla.github.io/archives/) can be found in large shopping malls located around the city. 
Nairobi has a bustling daytime economy but many shops and restaurants close early, around 11 pm. Security is taken very seriously, so always carry valid photo identification. The local dialect of Kiswahili is widely spoken in addition to English. Consider picking up some basic phrases to help you interact more smoothly. Public transportation includes **matatus** (privately operated minivans) and buses which can be crowded but are an affordable way to get around. Ride-hailing services like Uber are also very popular. Just be aware that Nairobi traffic is notorious, so allow extra time for trips.

### Exploring Natural Attractions
One of the best things about Nairobi is its proximity to natural beauty. Just a 30-minute drive from the city center lies the famous Nairobi National Park, the only national park in the world located within a capital city. Spread over 117 square kilometers, it is home to various predator and prey species that roam freely. Be sure to keep your windows rolled up as some animals like cheetahs and giraffes may approach your vehicle. You can spot the "Big 5" game - lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants, and buffalo - making it one of the top spots in Kenya for wildlife viewing. 
A bit further afield, but well worth a day trip is the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park. Here you can observe the heartwarming process of rescued baby elephants being rehabilitated before being reintroduced into the wild. The orphans enjoy bottles of milk and lush vegetation under the watchful eyes of their dedicated caretakers. Proceeds from entrance fees go towards the orphanage's operations as well as anti-poaching initiatives.
For a different kind of animal encounter, drive about 30 kilometers west of the city to the Ostrich Farm. Here you can hand-feed and get up close with the largest living birds in the world. Their blue-grey feathered bodies tower over visitors. The farm also sells crafts made from natural materials like wood, pottery, and of course leather goods utilizing ostrich skin. Savory grilled **ostrich meat** is served for lunch if you want to sample this unique game meat.
### Cultural Heritage and Nightlife
When it comes to arts, culture, and entertainment, Nairobi certainly doesn't disappoint visitors. The vibrant downtown area known as the Central Business District (CBD) comes alive from dusk till late with shopping, dining, performances, and nightclubs. Some top attractions include the busy open-air markets filled with handicrafts, clothing, and fresh produce. Major city squares like Uhuru Park and Freedom Corner are great spots for people watching.  
The National Museum of Kenya houses various exhibitions that showcase the history and diversity of the country's cultures. Art lovers won't want to miss the bustling Zimmerman Remodeling located right next door, featuring works by local contemporary artists. Theater fans can catch indoor plays and comedy acts at the Kenya National **Theater**. Live music venues around the city regularly host both international and local acts performing everything from jazz to hip hop to folk singing traditional tunes. 
For a truly memorable evening, head to Village Market - a vibrant open-air complex along Limuru Road hosting over 200 shops, restaurants, and event spaces. Wander through stalls selling handicrafts, gifts, and clothing then relax over drinks at one of the hip outdoor bars. Local DJs spin the latest beats as crowds dance the night away under the stars. No trip to Nairobi is complete without experiencing the lively energy and talent that the city has to offer after dark.
### Getting Around Safely and Smartly 
While parts of Nairobi can feel bustling and chaotic, with a bit of awareness most visitors find the city navigable. Here are some final tips for traveling smartly:
- Use established taxis, Uber, or reputable hotels to book transportation after dark for safety. 
- Avoid displaying expensive items like jewellery or flashy phones which could attract unwanted attention. 
- Only withdraw cash from ATMs located inside banks or large retail outlets for security. 
- Busy areas like bus stations and markets unfortunately see more petty theft - keep bags close at all times.
- Be wary of new "friends" who eagerly offer to show you around unsolicited. Stick to populated areas if being guided.
- Learn a few basic phrases in Kiswahili like "pole pole" (slowly) to get around language barriers politely.  
With proper precautions, most visitors embrace Nairobi's vibrant energy, cultural attractions, and accessibility to natural wonders without issues. I hope these tips provide a solid starting point to help you explore all that this fascinating city has to offer!
