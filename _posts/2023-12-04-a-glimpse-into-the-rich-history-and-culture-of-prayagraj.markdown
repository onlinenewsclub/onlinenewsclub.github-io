### Sacred Confluence of Rivers
Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad, is located at the sacred confluence of three holy rivers - the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati. This confluence, known as [Triveni Sangam](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-04-voyage-en-syrie-r-xe9cit-d-un-voyageur/), is considered highly auspicious in Hindu culture. Every 12 years, Prayagraj hosts the massive Kumbh Mela festival, where millions of pilgrims arrive to bath in the holy waters of Triveni Sangam and gather for religious celebrations. For Hindus, taking a dip at the Sangam during this auspicious festival is believed to rid one of sins and help attain salvation.
