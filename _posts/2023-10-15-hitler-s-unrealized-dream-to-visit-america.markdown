### The Influence of Karl May's Novels
Hitler had developed an idealized and romantic view of America from the popular western novels written by German author Karl May in the late 19th century. Novels like **"Winnetou"[ featured the adventures of characters like ](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-04-la-beaut-xe9-et-la-diversit-xe9-culturelle-unique-de-la-turquie/)"Old Shatterhand"** exploring the American frontier. This distorted lens led Hitler to perceive America as an undeveloped wilderness, underestimating the industrial and military might of the United States.

### Plans for a West Coast Compound
American Nazi sympathizers purchased a large estate near Los Angeles in the 1930s with the intention of establishing a West Coast base for Hitler and his followers. Designed by renowned African American architect Paul R. Williams, the 50-acre "**Hitler's House in Pacific Palisades**" compound included structures like stables, a power plant, and water treatment facilities. However, the outbreak of World War 2 prevented Hitler from ever visiting.
### Delegations Sent to Observe America
In attempts to understand American culture and influence opinion, Hitler sent delegations like film director Leni Riefenstahl who observed Hollywood movie production. She was only received by Walt Disney, whose anti-Semitic views aligned with Nazi ideology. Other delegations aimed to gain American corporate **support for Nazi Germany** but WWII put an end to such cooperation. 
### No Documented Visit by Hitler
While Hitler idolized the frontier spirit portrayed in Karl May's novels, his schedule between World Wars is well-documented without any lengthy gaps that could account for a transatlantic trip. Even if logistically possible given the travel times of over a week by ship, Hitler was quite vocal about his interests and unlikely would not have elaborated on visiting the **"Land of Unlimited Possibilities"** if it had occurred.
### Underestimating American Industrial Might  
Hitler's boyhood fascination with the American Old West, combined with a lack of first-hand experience, caused him to underestimate the full economic and military power of the United States. This miscalculation proved catastrophic when America mobilized its vast industrial base and manpower after the Japanese attack, tipping the scales against Nazi Germany in World War 2. Hitler's fantasy of America as an unspoiled frontier blinded him to the nation's burgeoning strength.
