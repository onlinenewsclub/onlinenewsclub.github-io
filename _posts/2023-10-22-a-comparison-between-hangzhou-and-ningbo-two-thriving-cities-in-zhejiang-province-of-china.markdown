Experienced workers can find opportunities in supervising construction of enormous cargo ships or offshore wind farms. The city also cultivates niche talents in trades like naval architecture.
## Weighing pros and cons for living choices
Both renowned cities offer high quality of life but each has tradeoffs depending on one's priorities:
