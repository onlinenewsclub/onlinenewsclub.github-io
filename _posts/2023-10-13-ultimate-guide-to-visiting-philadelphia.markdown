### Getting Around the City
Philadelphia has an excellent public transportation system that visitors can rely on to explore the city. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) operates buses, subways, elevated trains, regional rail lines, and trolley services. Purchasing a weekly transit pass provides unlimited rides on all modes of transit and is highly recommended for getting around. Download the SEPTA app to plan trips and see schedules. Rides are generally safe, affordable, and quicker than navigating congested city streets by car. Parking in Philadelphia can be extremely expensive and challenging to find. 
Public transit is the ideal way to access top attractions in the core urban neighborhoods. Central stations like 30th Street, Suburban, and Jefferson lay within walking distance of many popular destinations in [Center City](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-07-pourquoi-si-peu-de-touristes-mexicains-visitent-palau-une-analyse-des-obstacles-et-des-opportunit-xe9s/). Transport also links out to suburbs for day trips to historic sites. Commuter rail runs from airports right into downtown, a breezy start or end to any visit. With a SEPTA pass, tourists can easily reach the entire Greater Philadelphia region.
