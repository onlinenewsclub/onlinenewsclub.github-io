Surabaya is Indonesia's second largest city and makes for an interesting stopover in East Java. However, its appeal as a tourist destination is limited. Fortunately, there are plenty of things to see and do nearby, especially the majestic volcanic landscape at Gunung Bromo. This article provides a comprehensive itinerary for exploring both Surabaya and Gunung Bromo over 5 to 7 days.
### Shopping and Dining in Surabaya
Surabaya is known for its wide selection of modern shopping malls and traditional markets. Spend your first day exploring some of the top shopping destinations. At [Tunjungan Plaza](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-10-08-my-amazing-experience-visiting-israel/), you can find major brands and a busy food court. Those looking for more upscale shopping should head to **Galaxy Mall** or **Ciputra World**. For bargain hunting, check out the sprawling **Pasar Atum** fabric market. 
After shopping, indulge in some of Surabaya's iconic dishes. Must-try specialties include **rich beef rawon stew**, tangy **soto ayam soup**, and the peanut-coated **nasi pecel rice**.

### Exploring Surabaya's History and Culture
Get a dose of Surabaya's colonial past by visiting historical landmarks like the **Dutch-era Mojopahit Hotel** and the **House of Sampoerna**, a former tobacco factory-turned-cafe. Wander Surabaya's centuries-old harbor, **Kalimas Port**, where traditional fishing boats still dock. Those interested in the city's nature side can tour the **Wonorejo Mangrove Forest Park** or the decommissioned submarine at **Monkasel Monument**. Both provide glimpses into Surabaya's coastal ecology. 
In the evenings, relax at parks like **Taman Bungkul** where locals gather to socialize. Strike up a conversation to learn more about **Arek Suroboyo** culture and the easygoing Surabaya lifestyle. With its distinct blend of Javanese and coastal influences, the city offers a taste of "eastern Java" not found elsewhere.
### An Agricultural and Volcanic Wonder: Gunung Bromo
No visit to East Java is complete without admiring the region's most iconic natural landscape—the **Gunung Bromo volcanic caldera**. This unique site features an active volcano emerging from a vast, moonscape-like plain. It makes for jaw-dropping sunrises and photo opportunities galore.  
The most common way to see Bromo is on a sunrise tour from the nearby town of Probolinggo. Take an early bus from Surabaya to Probolinggo, then another shared minibus up to the base village of **Cemoro Lawang**. From there, hire a jeep or join a guided trek to reach the caldera for dawn. Be sure to dress warmly as temperatures plummet after dark. 
Witnessing the **volcano spew smoke** against the sky's vibrant colors is an experience unlike any other. If ambitious, consider hiking to viewpoints like **Bromo's crater rim** or the so-called **"Teletubbies" hills** for even more breathtaking vistas. The region's unique geological formations will leave explorers in awe of Mother Nature's power.
### More Sights Around Malang and Batu
With a few extra days, branch out to explore East Java's second major cities nearby—Malang and Batu. Malang is a cultural hub with numerous sites reflecting its student population. Wander busy **Jalan Besar Ijen** for shops and **Taman Pahlawan** park. Or visit **Museum Angkut** for exhibits on local transportation history. 
Venture further north to Batu for scenic highlands dotted with Hindu temples. Explore **Sawahi waterfall**, **Plengkung village**, and plantations of **clove**, **shallots**, and **chilies**. For relaxation, indulge in a **banana pancake** or local **kopi Susu** coffee. With Batu's cooler climate and Malang's cultured ambiance, both destinations offer welcome breaks from big-city bustle.  
Return to Surabaya recharged, having gained insights into Java's natural wonders, trade roots, and diverse communities of **Arek Suroboyo**, **Osing**, **Madura** and beyond. This itinerary balances active adventure with cultural immersion—a perfect way to experience the varied riches of East Java.
