### Outdoor Activities and Climate
When it comes to outdoor activities and climate, Miami has the edge. With its subtropical climate, Miami enjoys warm weather year-round, making it perfect for enjoying the beautiful beaches, boating, water sports, and other outdoor activities anytime. Meanwhile, Las Vegas has an arid desert climate with very hot summers and mild winters. Outdoor activities are limited, though the surrounding mountains offer hiking, cycling, and other options when weather permits.
### Culture, Cuisine and Shopping
Both cities offer diverse cultures and fantastic cuisine influenced by their demographics. In **Las Vegas dining and shopping**, you'll find Michelin-starred restaurants alongside all-you-can-eat buffets. World-class casinos, resorts, and the Las Vegas Strip are home to high-end shopping and entertainment. Meanwhile, Miami's diverse Latin influences are showcased through eclectic art, vibrant nightlife, and delicious food from around the globe. Shopping spans international brands to local boutiques. 
### Family Friendly Activities
While both cities cater well to adults seeking entertainment, Miami has a stronger array of family-friendly activities. The zoo, aquarium, science museum, parks and beaches give families more options compared to Las Vegas. However, Las Vegas does have theme parks like the Mirage Volcano and Bellagio Fountains, in addition to shows and attractions more suited for older children and adults. Factors like cost, space, and weather would influence which city is better for families.
### Transportation and Getting Around 
Miami is a much larger city geographically compared to the compact Las Vegas Strip area. Public transportation is more limited in car-dependent Vegas, whereas Miami offers robust public transit options via buses, trains, and streetcars to navigate the diverse cityscapes. Renting a car is advised for exploring further in both cities. **Uber, taxis and rideshares** provide convenient point-to-point transport within each city.
### Living Costs and Value
Housing, utilities and overall living costs are significantly higher in Miami versus Las Vegas. Property taxes, insurance, and rents skew more affordable overall in Vegas. However, this could be offset by higher incidental costs like entertainment, dining out and transportation in Las Vegas compared to Miami. The vibrant nightlife in both cities means planning a budget accordingly. Value-conscious travelers may get more bang for their buck in Las Vegas.
### Short Trips vs Long Stays
Las Vegas truly shines for a quick getaway with constant stimulation. A long weekend offers the perfect taste of the Vegas experience. However, for longer trips or permanent relocation, sprawling Miami provides superior outdoor recreational activities, culture, and more long-term attractions to remain engaged. Both cities offer limitless potential for creating memories - just pick your perfect length of stay between glittering Las Vegas and sun-soaked Miami.
In conclusion, both Las Vegas and Miami offer unique combinations of attractions, entertainment, culture and surroundings to suit different trip lengths and traveler preferences. Short trip visitors seeking non-stop excitement should choose Vegas, while longer trips allow experiencing everything enthralling Miami has to offer for all seasons. The final destination depends on individual interests and styles.
