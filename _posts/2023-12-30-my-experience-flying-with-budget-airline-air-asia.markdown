### [Cheap Fares but Potential for Delays](https://thetopnews.github.io/ps5-does-not-require-a-4k-television/)
Air Asia is known for offering incredibly low fares, which makes them very attractive when looking to book last minute flights or traveling on a tight budget. However, as the input mentions, these low prices sometimes come with a risk of delays or extra costs. One user described flights that were delayed 12+ hours on one occasion and over 5 hours on another, meaning extra time spent waiting at the airport. While the cheap tickets seem great initially, the total travel time ends up being much longer than expected. It's important to budget extra time for potential delays to avoid missed connections or appointments when flying with Air Asia.

### **Additional Fees for Amenities** 
Another common theme is that Air Asia charges extra fees for many items that are included without charge on full service airlines. Food, drinks, seat selection and luggage are some things the input notes you must pay extra for. Even cabin baggage is weighed and fees may apply if overweight. This helps Air Asia keep base fares very low but means the total cost of flying with them can add up once all the additions purchase are tallied. Be prepared to pay a la carte for amenities if trying to save money on an Air Asia flight.  
### **Spartan Cabin Experience**
Reviews describe the onboard experience as very basic, with no complimentary food or drinks offered. One user said the red decor felt overwhelming on their eyes as well. While getting from point A to B safely is the priority, the overall cabin ambiance seems rather lacking comforts compared to other airlines. Travelers seeking a more polished travel experience may find Air Asia flights feel too stripped down and transactional during the journey. However, the no-frills approach does minimize costs.
### **Convenient Non-Stop Options** 
Despite some downsides, Air Asia can offer great convenience that makes dealing with the potential irritations worthwhile. One reviewer mentioned their Air Asia flight was the only direct option available between Incheon, South Korea and Kalibo, Philippines. Not having to switch planes or transit through other airports saved significant time versus multi-stop itineraries. Especially for short-haul international routes, Air Asia often provides nonstop flight choices that major carriers don't. The time savings from flying direct can outweigh negatives like additional fees in many cases.
### **Staff Customer Service Skills Lacking**
Two comments criticized the attitude of Air Asia staff. One said customer service was comparable to "the ration card office in Matunga, Mumbai" - implying a bureaucratic and indifferent tone. Good customer service is important to air travel given the high-stress environment and potential for glitches like delays. If issues do occur, polite and helpful staff can soften the blow significantly. But based on reviews, it seems Air Asia crew lack the polished interpersonal skills of full-service airline employees. Their primary role appears to be safety/logistics focused over passenger care.
### **_In-Flight Crew Behavior Requires Improvement_** 
In a surprising anecdote, one reviewer shared observing public flirting and "ass grabbing" between Air Asia cabin crew during a flight. While likely unintentional to occur within view of passengers, such behavior falls far below professional standards and reflects poorly on the airline's culture and crew training. Air travel stresses safety and fairness as top priorities that all staff should uphold, especially in their conduct towards each other while working. Air Asia would do well to reinforce proper conduct guidelines to avoid future uncomfortable witnessing by travelers relying on them for transport.
### **Weigh Tradeoffs When Choosing Air Asia** 
In summary, Air Asia fills an important niche by offering budget-minded flyers markedly low base airfares. However, it is critical for travelers to be aware of the potential "gotchas" like extra fees, longer travel times due to delays, spartan onboard experience and customer service inconsistencies based on reviews. While the affordable rates are tempting, one must weigh whether anticipated inconveniences are worth the savings for their particular trip. For some, Air Asia allows fitting air travel into budgets that otherwise wouldn't, convenience of direct routings or accessing airports larger carriers don't serve. But their no-frills model requires careful consideration of personal priorities before choosing to fly.
