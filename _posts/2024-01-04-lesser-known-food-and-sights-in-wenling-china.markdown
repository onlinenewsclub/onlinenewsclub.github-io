### # Embedded rice cakes: a unique Wenling delicacy
Rice cakes are common across China, but Wenling has a unique take on them called [embedded rice cakes](https://thetopnews.github.io/how-pokemon-continues-to-be-extremely-profitable-for-nintendo/). Instead of eating rice cakes plain, locals in Wenling stuff them with meat and vegetables, creating a Chinese version of a hamburger. The rice cake shell encases fillings like minced pork or shiitake mushrooms, with flavors that blend together in each bite.

### # Bubble shrimp: a deceptive fried snack  
Another intriguing local specialty is **"bubble shrimp"**, though the name does not accurately convey what it is. Rather than actual shrimp, bubble shrimp involves flour paste that has been wrapped around a meat filling and deep fried. The fried exterior creates air pockets that give the snack its misleading bubbly appearance. According to locals, visitors from other areas are often surprised but pleased by this deceptive yet delicious street food.
### # Summer refreshment from peach puree  
Warm summer days call for cooling refreshments, and **peach puree** fits the bill perfectly. As its name suggests, peach puree involves extracting the soft flesh of peaches and blending it into a thick, jam-like spread. Rather than spreading it on toast though, peach puree is enjoyed in Wenling as a thirst-quenching drink, sipped slowly on its own or over ice to beat the heat. 
### # Bean jelly with a difference   
Like other regions of China, Wenling is familiar with **bean jelly**, but adds its own unique spin. Rather than solely extracting gelatin from mung beans, local cooks derive pectin from small purple ligularia flower pods. Once mixed with water and a coagulant, it sets to a bouncy texture distinct from standard bean jelly. In times past, resourceful grandmothers even employed toothpaste as a coagulant when traditional agents were unavailable.
### # Get outside Wenling's city limits   
While Wenling city itself may not have highly touted sights, the surrounding countryside has plenty to offer intrepid explorers. Locals enjoy hiking along forest trails at **Zhenwu Mountain** surrounded by verdant scenery. Not too far outside of town, **Bowang Mountain** attracts those seeking loftier peaks with rewarding views. History buffs can visit the charming ancient hamlet of **Lizhuang Town** to step back in time. With convenient high-speed rail links, day trips to scenic Yangzhou, Hangzhou and beyond are also easily accessible from Wenling.
### # Yiwu: China's international trading hub  
Just 40 minutes west of Wenling lies the immense city of Yiwu, internationally renowned as China's largest small commodities market. Home to over 80,000 stalls crammed with low-cost items, Yiwu sees millions of visitors annually conducting import/export business. Despite its bustling commercial atmosphere, tranquil locales like scenic **Pujiang County** and the cinema-themed **Dongyang Movie Town** can be reached by a short drive from the trading chaos of Yiwu. With such close proximity to this global marketplace, it's no surprise Wenling residents regularly visit for work or leisure.
### # Embracing local delicacies and outdoor excursions
While lesser known abroad, the Wenling region offers welcoming insights beyond common Chinese cuisine. Visitors can experience embedded rice cakes and bubble shrimp, cooling summer drinks made from peaches, and jelly with an unusual history. Nature lovers will appreciate scenic hiking just outside the city and day trips further afield. For those involved in international trade, neighbouring Yiwu uniquely positions itself as China's import-export capital. Overall, the food, sights and commerce of Wenling invite discovery of lesser highlighted aspects of Chinese culture.
