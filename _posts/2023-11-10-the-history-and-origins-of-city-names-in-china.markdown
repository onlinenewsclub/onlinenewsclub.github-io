This article examines the etymologies of several important place names in Chinese history, showing how their meanings and pronunciations have changed over millennia to reflect political boundaries, geographical features, and linguistic conventions. By analyzing toponyms like Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hefei, Nanchang, and Xi'an, one gains insights into the multifaceted development of regional identities and administration across Chinese civilization. Both the steady retention and transformation of Chinese place names illustrate how tradition intertwines with adaptation in this globally influential culture.
