### Understanding Local Perspectives 
I visited Cote d'Ivoire in 2009, just prior to the election and subsequent brief outburst of violence. As a privileged westerner, I held some terribly racist notions about Africa in general before my trip. We toured agricultural projects in **South Eastern Cote d'Ivoire** near Abengourou, Abidjan, and Agboville. [Through meaningful interactions with locals](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-09-vivre-xe0-bogot-xe1-la-capitale-de-la-colombie/), I gained a new perspective.

### Rethinking Preconceptions of Poverty
The biggest adjustment was realizing how wrong my assumptions were. I had grown up believing "Africa is a disaster" narratives, but Cote d'Ivoire showed otherwise. People were some of the **happiest and most content** I've met. **Simple dwellings don't necessarily indicate crippling poverty** - community and relationships mattered more than material gains. This challenged my beliefs around Western superiority.
### Appreciating a Slower Pace of Life 
Westerners worship watches and prioritize efficiency, but **Ivorians value time with friends and community over productivity**. Their work is no less dedicated, but they have room for meaningful engagement. **This was fascinating to witness firsthand** - a different way of living less concerned with the passage of time. 
### Embracing New Cultural Experiences
Food, language, and customs provide a glimpse into local life. **Strong French skills ease integration** while local dialects remain. **Indulging in diverse cuisines** like **attiéké** and **foutou** enriched my trip. **Eating with hands** took adjustment but added to cultural immersion.
### Navigating a Dynamic Capital 
About 20% of Ivorians live in **crowded, traffic-filled Abidjan** due to jobs and education. **Maintaining positivity amid challenges** is part of local character. Humor permeates all situations as shown in songs like "DJ Lewis Grippe Aviaire Clip Officiel". 
### Experiencing Vibrant Cuisine
Eating in Cote d'Ivoire feels like culinary heaven. Options include **chicken, fish, meat, local specialties and global imports**. **Southern wet seasons** bring downpours while **Harmattan seasons** are warm and dry.
### Adapting to Multiple Languages  
Over 70 languages exist alongside French. **Younger Ivorians converse in Nouchi**, a creative slang. **Witnessing linguistic diversity firsthand enriched my cultural understanding**. 
### Embracing a Consumerist Yet Affordable Society
Despite poverty, Ivorians showcase imported goods proudly. **Technology, vehicles and beauty products fill markets**. **Outsiders can easily access international brands**. This displays local aspirations despite economic realities.
### Gaining a Deeper Appreciation
My perceptions changed from assumptions of "African disaster" to respect for Ivorian resilience, community and character. **Cote d'Ivoire offered lessons on rethinking biases** while **deepening cultural knowledge through immersive experiences**. Outsiders can benefit immensely from this approach.
