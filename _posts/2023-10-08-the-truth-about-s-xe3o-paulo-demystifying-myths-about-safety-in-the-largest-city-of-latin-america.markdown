### A First-Hand Account
I just spent 6 months in S.Paulo for an internship working in the vibrant [financial district](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-04-la-s-xe9curit-xe9-au-nigeria-un-probl-xe8me-croissant/) called Faria Lima. Coming from Germany, one of the "safest" places in Europe, I was initially worried about safety in São Paulo given its reputation. However, during my daily commute of taking the bus, metro, and walking over 1.5km each way to work, **nothing happened**. 
For 150 days I walked to and from work, reading, listening to music or doing other activities without any issues. While I took normal safety precautions at night like taking taxis, the fears others expressed about dangers seemed overblown. The financial parts of the city felt like any modern urban center with tall buildings and busy streets.

### Diverse yet Welcoming City Centre 
The city centre, home to over 13 million people, bustles with activity as residents and workers go about their day. It's well-policed and many wealthy homes have security measures like guards and gates for protection. However, these precautions result more from the large population than actual danger. 
Wealthy high-rise condos stand next to more modest homes, reflecting the economic diversity. Those who can afford private security live with measures like controlled entry, but it's misleading to think the whole city is unsafe. With a huge population comes variation in all aspects of life.
### Enjoying Culture, Food and Nightlife Safely
Days are perfectly safe to explore cultural **attractions like museums, parks and theatres**. Outdoor dining and evening activities occur without issue too when taking normal precautions. My Brazilian friends were welcoming and ensured I had a great local experience, from restaurants to nightlife. 
Although electronics should be hidden on streets and casual clothing blended in more, taking photos was fine. Overall safety comes down to avoiding dangerous behaviors one wouldn't risk elsewhere. With care and common sense, São Paulo offers plentiful rewards for visitors.
### Residential Areas Feel Like Anywhere Else
Having lived in and around São Paulo for 18 **years**, I can say safety fears were overblown. I enjoyed living here and the residential areas felt identical to neighborhoods globally - families going about daily life. 
The financial districts like Faria Lima, Paulista and Berrini bustled daily with professionals on lunch breaks, just like business hubs worldwide. Seeing locals relax in outdoor settings, it was clear danger wasn't an omnipresent concern.
### Explore Diverse Attractions and Cuisine
With museums, gardens, concerts and more, São Paulo offers cultural riches rivaling global cities. With influence from worldwide immigration, its multi-ethnic character shines through in the diversity of cuisines, music, art and communities. 
Rather than denying oneself experiences due to inaccurate fears, open-mindedly exploring its authentic variety provides great rewards. Basic protective behaviors suffice to safely savor this global business hub's offerings. An enriching trip results from seeking the good within any place.
### Sound Advice for Safe Yet Enjoyable Trip
Focusing worries prevents fully appreciating life's gifts. Avoiding behaviors risking trouble anywhere keeps one safe here. Official transportation lets one confidently move about the sprawling metropolis. 
With an open and observant mindset, one gains balanced insights beyond fears. Locals welcome foreigners and ensure a memorable stay. Staying alert yet optimistic allows richness wherever found. Overall São Paulo, like all places, offers more benefits discovered through caring interactions than dwelling on potential dangers alone.
