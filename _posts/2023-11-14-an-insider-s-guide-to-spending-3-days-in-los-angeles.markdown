Los Angeles is world-famous for its beaches, entertainment industry, and vibrant culture. As a longtime LA resident, I've put together this insider's guide to help visitors spend 3 ideal days exploring the best of what LA has to offer. 
## A Fun-Filled Day at the Beach 
On your first day, start your morning right with breakfast at **Patrick's Roadhouse** in Venice for their famous biscuits and gravy. Located right near the beach, it's the perfect fuel for a fun day in the sun. Once you're full, head to nearby [Venice Beach](https://ustoday.github.io/contact/) to enjoy boogie boarding in the Pacific Ocean. You'll see a colorful array of characters, from fitness enthusiasts to musicians along the iconic boardwalk. After drying off, check out the bulking maneuvers of muscleheads at **Muscle Beach** or browse the eclectic shops along **Abbot Kinney**. 
For lunch, head to adjacent Santa Monica for fresher coastal cuisine at **Shutters on the Beach**. Afterward, take a scenic ride on the ** solar-powered Ferris wheel** at Santa Monica Pier for panoramic views of the coastline. As the sun starts to set, drive into Downtown LA and experience the architectural wonder and culinary delights at **Clifton's Cafeteria**. End your beach day on a literary note browsing the walls of books at **The Last Bookstore** before heading back to Venice.
### Exploring Iconic Hollywood Attractions
Rise early on your second day to grab breakfast at the diverse food stalls of **Grand Central Market**. Afterwards, drive up to Griffith Park and take in the dazzling views of the Hollywood Hills and Downtown skyline from the **Griffith Observatory**. Pay your respects to the stars at the hand and footprints outside the legendary **Tull Chinese Theatre**. Spend the afternoon immersing yourself in the magic of movies on a VIP tour at **Universal Studios Hollywood**. Have dinner and drinks at the festive Universal CityWalk or explore the vibrant **LGBTQ nightlife** in West Hollywood if that's your scene.

### A Day Trip to Malibu and Los Angeles Museums
On your final day of exploration, reserve parking ahead of time at the **Getty Villa** in Malibu to view their exquisite antiquities inspired by an Italian villa. With its beautiful coastal setting, it's worth arriving early to fully immerse yourself. Next, head to Mid-City to experience world-class exhibitions at the **Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)**. Round out your artistic journey at the **Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)** downtown or the innovative **The Broad** museum to see cutting-edge installations. Take one last scenic drive along the Pacific Coast Highway before heading to LAX with amazing memories from your LA getaway.
## An Awesome Foodie Experience in LA's Culinary Scene 
Beyond the beaches and attractions, LA is defined by its diverse and innovative culinary culture. On your first evening, start with rustic American fare and whiskey cocktails at **Hearth & Hound** in Studio City. The next day, dine family-style on authentic Neapolitan pizza baked in a wood-fired oven at **Pizzeria Mozza** in Newport Beach. Wrap up your trip indulging in modern Mexican cuisine and creative cocktails at acclaimed **B.S. Taqueria** downtown. You'll leave sated yet longing to return to continue exploring LA's delectable food scene.
### An Insider's Walking Food Tour of Downtown LA
With so many delicious options, taking a walking food tour is a great way to sample diverse cuisines without overcommitting your schedule. Reserve a spot on the **"Tastes of Downtown LA"** tour offered by **Chowhound Walking Tours** and let their expert local guide introduce you to the area's culinary treasures. Start your morning stopping for coffee and pastries **Lasita Bakery**, then nibble tapas and pintxos at **Barrio Star**. After, enjoy tacos and micheladas at **Guerrilla Tacos** in the trendy Arts District. Your tour ends with sweets like churros and alfajores from **Frontera** to fuel the rest of your day's explorations.
### A Picturesque Picnic in Griffith Park 
Pack a picnic for an afternoon escape to sprawling **Griffith Park**. Drive up to the Griffith Observatory and follow trails leading down to the Greek Theater for panoramic views of the Hollywood Hills. Set up your spread near the rustic **Bronson Canyon Bridge** and enjoy your feast surrounded by sycamore trees and babbling creeks. Be sure to pack **tortas** from B.S. Taqueria, seasonal pizza from Pizzeria Mozza, cheeses and charcuterie from Santa Monica Whole Foods. Wash it all down with a bottle of Spanish wine, then relax and take in the natural beauty and fresh air. Your picnic is the perfect recharge before heading back for your final night in the city.
## Fond Farewells to Fabulous LA 
To end your visit on a high note, make reservations for your last dinner at one of LA's most acclaimed restaurants. For elegant Californian fare, book a prix-fixe tasting menu at **Brentwood's Providence**. Seafood lovers won't want to miss the ceviche and crustaceans at indoor/outdoor **Campanile** in Los Feliz. Or for a truly memorable meal, splurge on creative contemporary American cuisine amid dramatic design at Michelin-starred **Californios** downtown in the Arts District. Savor every delectable bite, knowing you'll want to return again soon to further experience the diverse delights of Los Angeles.
