### Relying on Handlebar and Helmet Mounted Mirrors
As a senior cyclist with vision impairment, I had relied on handlebar and helmet mounted mirrors for many years to see traffic behind me. However, the convex shape of handlebar mirrors distorted the view and caused headaches. While helmet mirrors provided a clearer image, the constant shaking from rough roads made it difficult to get a stable view of what was behind.

### Discovering the Benefits of Flat Wrist Mirrors
Then 15 years ago, I came across flat wrist mirrors designed specifically for cyclists. Being able to simply glance down at my wrist to check for traffic solved many of the issues I faced with other mirror options. The flat and undistorted design allowed me to easily see what was behind without additional shaking or distortions. 
Within a week of using one, I was already accustomed to the new perspective. Now, I can't imagine cycling without the added safety and peace of mind a wrist mirror provides. While it took some adjustment, the benefits of an unobstructed [rear view](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-27-merveilleuses-destinations-en-arm-xe9nie-pour-les-voyageurs/) have made flat wrist mirrors my preferred mirror option for safe cycling.
### Choosing the Right **Flat Wrist Mirror** Design
There are several flat wrist mirror designs available for cyclists today. When choosing, it's important to consider factors like viewing angle, adjustability, durability, and price. 
A wide viewing angle of at least 135 degrees is ideal so you can see traffic approaching from the sides. Adjustability is also key so the mirror position is customizable for comfort and optimal visibility. Materials should be shatterproof and weather resistant to stand up to bumps or moisture. Price largely depends on brand but quality wrist mirrors usually range from $10-30.
Two top options I've found that meet these criteria are the BriskMore Bike Wrist Mirror and ROCKBROS Bike Wrist Mirror. Both provide wide 180 and 135 degree views respectively. They can swivel 360 degrees for perfect adjustment and use durable ABS plastic construction. Their affordable price points under $20 also make them great values.
### Additional Flat Wrist Mirror Considerations
Beyond basic features, there are some other factors specific to your needs as a senior cyclist to consider:
The size of the mirror may matter depending on your wrist size. Some models come in small, medium, and large options to fit different wrist circumferences. A larger 1-2 inch mirror provides a more expansive **field of view** but may feel bulkier. 
Clarity is especially important with impaired vision. Look for mirrors made of high-qualityacrylic rather than cheap plastic to avoid image distortion. Anti-fog and anti-glare coatings can also help visibility in various conditions.
Ease of installation should also be considered if you have dexterity issues. Quick-release designs that tape or strap on comfortably in seconds are preferable to fiddly clips or screws
With these additional considerations in mind, the Epicover Bike Wrist Mirror may be your best choice. Made of top-grade acrylic, it offers a wide 180 degree view alongside anti-fog and anti-glare coatings. A simple hook-and-loop strap allows swift, one-handed installation too.
### Getting Used to the New Perspective 
Adapting to the different orientation of checking over your wrist does take some practice at first. But as promised in my initial experience, it only takes around a week to fully adjust. Movement will feel a little unnatural compared to turning your head but becomes second nature over time. 
Once accustomed, you gain a new appreciation for the benefits. No more craning your neck or dealing with unstable views. Traffic awareness becomes more instinctive with a simple flick of your eyes. And the safety impact is undoubtedly worth the initial adjustment period for senior cyclists.
Within the first month, I found myself automatically checking my wrist at intersections or stopping, without consciously thinking about it. It soon became an essential habit ingrained through regular use on my rides. Fifteen years later, I still wouldn't consider cycling without one for added reassurance.
### The Joy of Cycling Safely Well into Retirement
Being able to continue enjoying my favorite form of exercise and recreation into my retirement has brought me so much happiness. A flat wrist mirror has played a major role in allowing that by giving me the confidence and awareness to feel secure on the road.
Now at 74, I have no intention of stopping my regular rides any time soon. With the help of affordable safety aids like these mirrors, more seniors should feel empowered to stay active through hobbies like cycling well into their later years too. Our vision or abilities may decline with age, but adaptive gear ensures the joy of the open road doesn't have to end.
Though it takes adjustment, a high-quality flat wrist mirror provides clear vision of traffic for a very reasonable price. For concerned senior cyclists with any level of vision impairment, I cannot recommend them enough. Try one - you'll soon wonder how you ever rode without the added reassurance of this clever solution behind you at all times.
