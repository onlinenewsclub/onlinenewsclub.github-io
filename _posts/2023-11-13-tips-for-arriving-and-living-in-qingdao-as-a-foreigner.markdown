## Getting set up for your trip  
### [Prepare communication tools](https://codeces.github.io/2024-01-09-avustralya-vatanda-u015fl-u0131-u011f-u0131-ald-u0131ktan-sonra-hindistan-a-seyahat-etmek/)
One of the most important things to do before visiting China is to subscribe to a reliable VPN service. This will allow you to access websites like Google, Facebook, and your social media feeds which are blocked in mainland China. You'll also want to create WeChat and Alipay accounts during your first week in Qingdao. WeChat is the most widely used messaging and social media app in China, and is essential for communicating with locals and businesses. Alipay is the dominant mobile payment platform, similar to PayPal, and you'll need it to easily pay for taxis, food deliveries, and purchases while traveling around the city.

### **Familiarize yourself with transportation** 
Another critical tool is the Didi Chuxing app, China's largest ride-hailing service similar to Uber. With Didi you can easily order taxis and private drivers to get around Qingdao. As a newcomer, it's a good idea to initially rely on Didi rather than taking unfamiliar local buses or trains. Be sure to have the app downloaded and your payment methods linked before arriving. Once you get more comfortable with the city layout, you'll find public transportation is very affordable and accessible for getting around.
## Setting up your living situation
### **Choose accommodation wisely**  
When booking your first accommodations in Qingdao, opt for a hotel or hostel located near the city center or tourist areas for proximity to attractions, restaurants, and transportation. Hotels like **Qingdao Sunrise Hotel** and **Motel 168** are economical yet conveniently situated options. Ask the front desk to write your address in simplified Chinese characters—this handy paper will help you communicate where you're staying to taxi drivers if you ever need help finding your way back. 
### **Stock up on necessities**
Once settled into your lodging, take a trip to the local supermarket to stock up on water, snacks, and basic toiletries. Popular nationwide chains like **Carrefour** and **RT-Mart** are found throughout Qingdao and have many of the same items you find abroad. Wander the aisles to pick up locally produced drinks, snacks like mooncakes and crispy duck, and pantry essentials. Having some food in your room is handy for avoiding uncertainty or culture shock that can come with street food.
## Exploring Qingdao safely and enjoyably
### **Visit top attractions during the day**
Qingdao is rich with cultural and natural landmarks worth seeing. Top sights within easy reach include **Zhan Qiao Pier**, the distinctive scenic gardens along **Shinan Beach**, and climbing up to take in panoramic city views from **Signal Hill Park**. Get an early start exploring and stick to crowded, well-lit areas during daylight hours for safety. Hiring an English-speaking guide through apps like **Meituan** can also ease navigation and provide valuable background.
### **Opt for well-known restaurants at night**  
When it comes to dining out after dark, **stick to reputable chains and busy local eateries** over street stalls where food quality can be unpredictable. Local mini-programs and review sites like Meituan and Dazhong Dianping indicate popularity and reviews to guide your choices. Cuisine styles like Shandong noodles, seafood hotpot, and xiaolongbao dumplings are regional specialties worth trying in a clean, well-lit setting. **Restaurants at major hotels** also offer dishes with an international flair in a comfortable atmosphere ideal for newcomers.
## Adjusting to cultural differences smoothly
### **Be Mindful of common hazards**
As with any new destination, there are minor adjustments when adapting to life in China. While Qingdao has low crime overall, **exercise caution regarding knock-off brand goods** that are more readily available versus foreign markets. Imported alcohol and cigarettes in particular often have questionable ingredients or accuracy. Similarly, **street food quality can be hit or miss**—opt for well-prepared dishes in known kitchens initially as your body adjusts. Carrying your lodging address in Chinese characters is also a basic safety step.
### **Learn key phrases in Mandarin**  
Taking the time to learn a few simple Mandarin phrases like Hello (Ni Hao), Thank You (Xiè Xiè), and asking for directions, goes a long way with locals. **Language apps like HelloChinese** make absorbing basics surprisingly easy and fun, helping you better navigate the culture. Remember the tonal nature of the language when practicing. Exposing yourself to Chinese TV shows, movies, or music on streaming services is another low-pressure method of picking up common words and expressions over time.  
### **Maintain patience and flexibility**
Compared to back home, you may find daily tasks take longer in China due to factors like language barriers, different customs, or a different pace of life. However, most Chinese people are quite friendly and helpful toward respectful foreign visitors making an effort. Maintaining patience and an open mindset will serve you well as daily living adjustments are made. View unexpected experiences as opportunities to learn about this ancient yet modernizing culture.
## Leaving QIngdao with fond memories
### **Reflect on your experience** 
Whether staying one week or one month, taking time near the end of your trip to look back at new sights seen, foods tried, and people met will create lasting impressions. Jot notes in a travel journal on highlights, your evolving thoughts on Chinese culture, and any new interests sparked to bring home souvenirs of remembrance. Reviewing photos on the train ride to your next destination makes the journey itself feel like another adventure.
### **Express gratitude to your new contacts**  
Consider sending a personalized message to anyone like hotel staff, restaurant servers, or local friends who made your experience in Qingdao extra special. A quick appreciation note goes far in Chinese culture and may even strengthen future opportunities to reconnect if returning someday. Best of all, you'll depart China with heartwarming memories of the generosity of strangers who became smiling faces.  
### **Begin planning your next visit already**!
Chances are the diverse attractions, cuisine, and experiences that make Qingdao so liveable and visitor-friendly have ignited a desire to someday return to explore even more. Start bookmarking additional areas of interest to research between now and then. You'll discover Qingdao has much left to offer on your next adventure in this scenic coastal city.
