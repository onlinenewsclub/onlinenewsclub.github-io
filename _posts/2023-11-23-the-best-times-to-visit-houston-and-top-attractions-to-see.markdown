Many botanical gardens and parks hold spring festivals and events to showcase their gardens at their peak. This is a **great time** to enjoy outdoor activities like running, cycling, hiking, and trips to the zoo and parks.

### **Summer Activities Indoors** 
The summer months of May through August bring notoriously hot and humid weather to Houston. However, 99.99% of indoor attractions and activities will have robust air conditioning. Houston has a **top-notch underground tunnel system** connecting many of the buildings and towers in the downtown area. You can easily walk from place to place staying cool through this system. World-class museums like the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, The Menil Collection, and Houston Museum of Natural Science offer respite from the heat. Don't forget to visit the excellent Clayton Library for genealogical research.
### **Autumn Festivals and Events**
Fall is one of the most pleasant times to visit Houston, running from September through November. The weather cools down significantly with average highs in the low 80s. Cultural activities are in full swing during this season. Houston is renowned for its **performing arts scene** with excellent opera, ballet, theater, and symphony seasons. Community events and outdoor concerts also ramp up. The **largest Renaissance festival** in the nation takes place north of Houston during autumn weekends. Don't miss out on the famous Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a sprawling festival with games, music, food, and epic rodeo competitions. 
### **Holiday Cheer in December** 
December brings the holiday season to Houston. Many neighborhoods, buildings, and public spaces decorate elaborately with festive **lights and decorations**. Downtown in particular puts on a spectacular lighting display. Visitors can experience a variety of holiday events, festivals, and celebrations throughout the city. Check local listings for parades, shows, and other seasonal activities. Houston's museums and cultural attractions often have special exhibitions. The balmy winter weather makes strolling and outdoor activities still quite pleasurable. Average highs are in the mid-60s Fahrenheit.
### **Wintertime Chills**
While not as cold as northern regions, Houston can see occasional chilly spells in January and February. Average highs are in the low 60s but it feels colder with high humidity. Make the most of indoor activities on chillier days. Many Houston facilities and institutions offer interesting exhibitions, shows, lectures and more during the winter off-season too. However, visitors wishing to enjoy outdoor activities may find it less appealing with mornings around freezing and the sun setting earlier each afternoon. Late January through mid-February could see an **occasional Arctic cold front** bringing unseasonably cold temperatures near freezing as well.

Sports tourism reaches a fever pitch during the **MLB postseason** and NFL playoffs in fall and winter.
