### Beijing: The Classic Attractions 
In Beijing, I explored the classic attractions like the [Forbidden City](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-28-planifier-un-voyage-xe9conomique-et-m-xe9morable-en-tha-xeflande/) and **Temple of Heaven**. Even though the crowds were huge, wandering around the architecture and history was fascinating. One morning, I walked around the **hutongs** - the ancient alleyways - and experienced a slice of everyday local life. Mothers chatted outside homes while children played, giving me glimpses of **Beijing's local culture**.

### Chengdu: Panda Park and Spicy Food
Next, I traveled to Chengdu by high-speed train. The journey took around 6 hours but was very comfortable. In Chengdu, one of my highlights was visiting **Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding**. I spent hours watching the **pandas eat, play, and nap**. It was heartwarming to see the conservation efforts for these endangered animals. I also loved exploring the cuisine scene in Chengdu. I indulged in dishes like **mapo tofu**, Sichuan hot pot, and **spicy chicken**. The bold flavors were unlike anything I'd tasted before.
### Chongqing: The Modern Metropolis 
From Chengdu, I embarked on a short high-speed train ride to Chongqing. Known as one of China's fastest growing cities, Chongqing amazed me with its futuristic skyline and massive urban population. While the city had a bustling, modern feel, I was still able to visit remnants of old China like the **Ciqikou Ancient Town**. Walking along the steps and winding alleyways gave me a taste of Chongqing's history amidst towering skyscrapers. At night, I also enjoyed the lively **night markets** filled with delicious local snacks.
### Untamed Natural Beauty of Zhangjiajie 
After a few days exploring Chongqing, I took a domestic flight further west to the city of Zhangjiajie. Nestled within the breathtaking Wulingyuan scenic area, Zhangjiajie is renowned for its **Karst rock formations** resembling those found in Avatar. I spent two full days hiking misty trails among the quartzite sandstone pillars and cliffs overlooking deep turquoise ravines. Witnessing this **untamed natural beauty firsthand** was surreal and left me in total awe of the unique landscapes. 
### Between Chengdu and Chongqing: Leshan Giant Buddha
On my return high-speed train journey from Chengdu to Chongqing, I made a stop in Leshan to see the iconic **Leshan Giant Buddha**. At 71 meters tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world carved out of a mountain face. Gazing upon its immense form perched above the confluence of 3 rivers was quite simply majestic. The detailwork on the Buddha's face and robe after over 1200 years was also astounding. The sheer scale of this **UNESCO World Heritage Site** blew me away.
### Yangshuo: Limestone Karsts and Fulfilling Photoshoot
My final destination on this solo China trip was Yangshuo, a rural county located between Guilin and Lijiang. What I didn't expect upon arriving was the plethora of **towering karst limestone mountains** dominating the landscape. I spent two full days in and around the Li River hiking, cycling, and just admiring the fairy tale scenery. One experience I won't forget was hiring a photographer and models to fulfill my dream of being among the karsts for professional photoshoots. Wandering among the limestone pillars captured memories I'll forever cherish of this **magical corner of China**.
