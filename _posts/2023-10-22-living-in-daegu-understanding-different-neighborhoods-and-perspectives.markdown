### Exploring Neighborhood Options  
Daegu is a large city with various neighborhoods to choose from. While statistics show it has a low crime rate overall, one must consider individual characteristics when deciding where to live. **Suseong-gu wealthiest neighborhood Daegu** stands out as very comfortable due to its affluence and natural amenities like Suseong Lake. Near the main station, Eunhaeng-dong provides convenience but other areas offer value too.

### Downtown District and Student Hub
Dunsan-dong is downtown Daegu and quite busy with shops, restaurants, and city services. Rent is higher there since it is centrally located for easy access anywhere in the city. However, places like **Gung-dong KAIST neighborhood Daegu** offer nice supermarkets, nightlife, riverside parks and lower rents while still being developed. As a university area, it has young energy and attractions for students.
### Outer Suburb with Space and Bargains 
Sinseong-dong located further out has much more reasonable housing costs. While more removed, residents can still find everything they need in the local community. The writer enjoyed living affordably in both downtown and outer areas during their time in Daegu. Each setting presents tradeoffs to consider around budget, transportation and lifestyle preferences.
### Teaching Experience in Summer Heat   
An American expat shares taking a job teaching English in Daegu from 2013 to 2014. They comment the hot, humid summers were challenging even by Korean standards. However, the conservative social attitudes in Daegu came as more of a surprise, encountering unjust treatment uncommon in cosmopolitan Seoul.
### Facing Discrimination and Repression
As a black immigrant, no discrimination was personally faced in Seoul. However in Daegu, racism was all too common. Women also seemed more socially confined. School violence and inappropriate comments from older men added to feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable living there long-term. These societal elements added difficulties beyond just the weather.
### Contrast to Progressive Seoul 
After moving to Seoul, a more international environment allowed integration without facing the same issues. While open to revisiting Korea, Daegu specifically is off the table due concerns over its reputation as unusually traditional even within the country. Living anywhere requires fitting with the surrounding culture's principles of inclusiveness, freedom and quality of life - which Seoul appeared to demonstrate better in this case. 
### Weighing Personal Values in Any Move
In summary, both objective data and one's experiences highlight tradeoffs to weigh for each neighborhood or city. While safety statistics alone portrayed Daegu positively, socio-cultural factors significantly impacted livability. Personal values like acceptance, opportunities and comfort level amid community attitudes must also be priorities in finding the right long-term living situation. Researching diverse viewpoints can fill out one's understanding before making such an impactful decision.
