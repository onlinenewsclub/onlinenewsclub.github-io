### Exotic IceHotel in Kiruna, Sweden  
The [ice hotel construction Kiruna Sweden](https://thetopnews.github.io/page14/) truly provides an exotic experience like no other. Constructed entirely from ice blocks taken from the nearby Torne River, artists are invited each year to design one-of-a-kind rooms, decorations, and installations made of ice. Besides unique bedrooms carved within the frigid structure, there is an ice bar with drinking glasses made of frozen water, and an ice chapel popular for wedding ceremonies. Guests must wear thermal clothing during their overnight stay as the temperature inside remains a bone-chilling -5°C. While an undeniably touristy attraction, sleeping amid the sculpted ice designs in sub-zero conditions creates memories that will last forever.

### Scramble Crossing Chaos in Shibuya, Tokyo
For a quintessential Japanese experience, visiting the **Shibuya scramble crossing Starbucks** offers prime views of the legendary busy intersection. Each time the walking signals change, thousands of people stream across the crossing in all directions in a sea of human traffic. As one of Tokyo's most iconic spots, it's a must-see even if just to say you witnessed the chaos firsthand. Spending time people watching from the overhead seating at Starbucks gives tourists the perfect vantage point high above the controlled mayhem unfolding below. 
### Brews and Banter at Oktoberfest 
Held annually in Munich, Germany, **Oktoberfest beer festival** transforms the fairgrounds into a raucous celebration that draws over 6 million revelers each year. While navigating the crowded beer tents requires patience, the infectious energy, traditional dirndl outfits, oompah music performances, and steins of crisp lager flowing freely create an atmosphere unlike any other. Getting snapped with a stein of brew at one of the legendary beer halls makes for an unforgettable photo to remember the rowdy good times by. Even with the high admission prices and weekend rush, Oktoberfest delivers an experience worth braving the tourist crowds for.
### Underground Salt Cathedral Near Bogota
A more serene attraction, the **Zipaquira salt mine cathedral Colombia** church constructed deep within the tunnels of a salt mine provides a surreal experience. Located north of Bogotá, journeying underground to see the immense Catholic church carved by hand within the cavernous salt walls gives the sense of stepping into a fantasy realm. Sculptures, complex designs, and an organ made entirely of salt astound visitors in this one-of-a-kind subterranean place of worship. Though certainly geared towards tourists, the Cathedral's ingenious man-made wonder leaves a strong impression long after exiting back up to the surface.
### Magical Realms at Disney Parks 
As one of the most famous tourist traps worldwide, **Disneyland theme park California** still manages to enchant both children and adults alike with perfectly detailed fantasies brought to life. From classic lands like Main Street USA and Fantasyland, to innovative immersive areas like Pandora and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Disney delivers oasis of joy, nostalgia, and pure imagination. Rides and attractions deliver thrills and storytelling like nowhere else, while character interactions and fireworks displays offer magic you have to see to believe. Universal Studios and other mega-parks try to recreate the Disney magic but never quite capture it. Forcreating childhood memories or reliving your own, Disney remains unrivaled.
### Feeding Toucans in La Paz 
In lovely **La Paz Waterfall Gardens Costa Rica**, one experience stands out among lush trails winding past stunning vistas - encountering tropical birds so close you can feed them by hand. Toucans glide between trees, their colorful oversized beaks unmistakable. But here, you can have one land softly on your outstretched arm for a nibble, its bejeweled beak merely inches from your face. Monkeys and sloths cavort overhead as hummingbirds zip past. Offering animal encounters this intimate makes La Paz a one-of-a-kind nature attraction that leaves guests in awe, even if a few shops pique tourist wallets on exit. The unforgettable animal interactions are worth any price of admission.
### Relaxing Waters at Blue Lagoon 
Situated in a lava field in southwest Iceland, the **Blue Lagoon geothermal spa** 's milky azure waters emanate from a plant that harnesses local geothermal seawater. Skeptics expecting an overhyped tourist trap are instead treated to a sublime experience. Gliding through the mineral-rich warm waters, steam rising gently all around, induces a state of utter calm and relaxation. Silky silica mud applied to the skin leaves it baby soft, while luxurious in-water amenities like beer and snacks complete relaxation. Stunning black sand and mossy green surroundings make the lagoon as scenic as it is restorative. Even on busy summer days, the serenity of Blue Lagoon works its magic on all visitors. Its healing waters make it Iceland's true star attraction.
