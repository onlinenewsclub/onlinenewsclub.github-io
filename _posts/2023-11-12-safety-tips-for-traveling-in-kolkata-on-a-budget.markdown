Kolkata is one of the cheapest cities to visit in India, however, there are certain areas travelers should avoid for safety reasons, especially at night. This guide provides budget travel tips and safety advice for exploring Kolkata while sticking to a low budget.
### Public Transportation is the Budget Friendly Option 
Taking public transportation like buses and metros is significantly cheaper than taxis in Kolkata. [Yellow taxis](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-04-visite-au-bangladesh-tout-ce-que-vous-devez-savoir-avant-votre-voyage/) are not recommended as drivers often refuse to use meters and overcharge. Apps like **Ola** and **Uber** provide a safer alternative but can be more expensive than other Indian cities. Stick to public buses and the metro which run frequently and cost just Rs. 5-10 per ride. Download maps before traveling to easily navigate the public transportation system.

### Avoid Notorious Areas at Night
Some areas in the city are best avoided after dark for safety. **Sonagachi**, known as Asia's largest **red-light district**, sees a lot of illegal activities at night so steer clear after 9pm. **ESplanade** transforms into a hub for drug dealers and crimes late evening. **Mallick Bajar**, **Metiabruz**, **Khudderpore** and **Rajabazar** are risky even during the day with reports of robberies and muggings. **Ganga ghats** by the river are beautiful but hazardous alone after 10pm. Take taxis directly to and from these areas if visiting in the evening. 
### Affordable Lodging in Safe Neighborhoods
Look for budget accommodations in centrally located, busy areas like **Howrah**, **Bhowanipore**, **Burrabazar** for additional security. South Kolkata neighborhoods like **Bhawanipur**, **Kalighat**, **Alipore** offer good value hostels, guesthouses and budget hotels starting Rs. 500-800 without compromising on safety. Avoid **Sealdah** which has below average standards and security for the price. Verify properties and neighborhoods online before booking.
### Street Food is a Thrifty Dining Option 
Skip expensive sit-down restaurants and dine at local street stalls serving delicious, affordable **Bengali cuisine**. Kolkata is renowned for its street food culture. Savour budget treats like **kati rolls**, **jhaal muri**, **Beguni** for Rs. 20-50. Markets like **New Market**, **Lake Market** have great night food stalls. **Park Street** is lively and safe for street dining till 10pm. **Chinatown** in **Tangra** is another budget friendly area for Chinese street food. 
### Discount Tours of Popular Landmarks
Rather than solo travel, opt for guided walking **group tours** of landmarks. These cost Rs. 150-300 for a half day covering top sights with an informed guide. Explore iconic buildings in **Park Circut** on foot along with others for safety in numbers. **Victoria Memorial**, **Indian Museum**, **Dalhousie Square**, **Howrah Bridge** are must-visits covered by reputed budget tour companies. Book in advance online or at guesthouses for best rates.
### Enjoy Free Entertainment and Recreation 
Escape the summer heat by the **Hooghly River** or at **Maidan** - the city's iconic central park. Laze in the park or watch **Kolkata Knight Riders** practice sessions for free entertainment. Catch performing arts shows at **Rabindra Sadan**, visit universities like **Presidency** which hold regular lectures and exhibitions. Wander colorful flower markets like **Posta Bazaar** on weekends. Most cultural activities in the city are conveniently located and complimentary. 
### Follow Basic Safety Measures
Be vigilant in crowded areas and avoid showing expensive items or large amounts of cash. Only carry essentials and photocopies of documents. Mention your travel plans to your host or contact. Download translation apps, but avoid getting into lengthy conversations with strangers. Seek recommendations from locals for trusted taxi services after dark. Stick to main roads and leave vacation mode to blend with residents. With care and common sense, Kolkata offers budget travels joys aplenty.
