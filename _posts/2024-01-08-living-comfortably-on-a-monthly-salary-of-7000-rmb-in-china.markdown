### Housing Options
With a monthly salary of 7000 RMB, housing should not be a major issue in most Chinese cities. In larger tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai, one would not be able to afford property in the wealthy inner city areas. However, the outer suburban rings provide more affordable options. 
Data from Numbeo indicates the average cost of a single bedroom apartment in the outer rings of Shanghai is around 4563.89 RMB per month. Adding expected utilities and other housing expenses, total monthly housing costs would be around 6000 RMB, well within the 7000 RMB monthly salary. Similar housing costs can be found in other major cities.

### Transportation Without Owning a Car
Public transportation infrastructure is highly developed in Chinese cities, providing convenient transportation options without the high costs of car ownership. Subways, buses and other public transit allow easy navigation around the city. For areas not well served by public transit, electric [bikes](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-06-u5fb7-u56fd-u5206-u88c2-u65f6-u671f-u897f-u67cf-u6797-u4e0e-u897f-u5fb7-u4e4b-u95f4-u7684-u4ea4-u90/) and **scooters** provide affordable transport alternatives. Without needing to budget for a private vehicle, more of the 7000 RMB salary can go towards other living expenses.
### Purchasing an Affordable Vehicle 
While not necessary, those wanting their own four-wheeled transport have affordable options through domestic automakers. Economy cars from brands like Great Wall Motors export models for around 18000 AUD internationally, equivalent to 83000 RMB to purchase outright. Financing such a vehicle over 10 years brings the monthly payment down to around 692 RMB, leaving plenty from the 7000 RMB salary to cover ownership costs. Reliable personal transportation can thus be attained without breaking the monthly budget.
### Ample Funds Remaining for Other Expenses
After accounting for housing and potential vehicle costs, significant funds would still remain from the 7000 RMB monthly salary. Estimating 6000 RMB for housing and 1000 RMB max for transportation leaves 1000 RMB minimum each month for other living expenses. According to Numbeo, the average cost of food and misc. items in Chinese cities is around 705 RMB monthly per person. This leaves roughly 295 RMB as flexible disposable income, more than enough to enjoy entertainment, dining out occasionally, and maintain a reasonable standard of living.
### Living Comfortably in Less Expensive Cities  
Those willing to reside outside of the most expensive tier 1 cities will find living on 7000 RMB per month provides even greater comfort. Housing, food and transportation costs are markedly lower in tier 2 and tier 3 locations. The same salary potentially covers higher quality housing and allows greater flexibility in discretionary spending. For individuals seeking an affordable yet comfortable lifestyle, smaller Chinese cities present highly livable options given a monthly income of 7000 RMB.
### Sufficient Funding for Family or Future Expenses
While a single person can live quite comfortably on 7000 RMB monthly, it also provides a suitable income to take on greater financial responsibilities. Housing a family, saving for the future or assisting elderly parents are all viable given this salary level. After accounting for reasonable solo living costs, 1000-2000 RMB remains monthly that could fund family additions or long term savings goals. Even in China's largest, most affluent cities, 7000 RMB per person keeps future possibilities open while living comfortably today.
### Conclusion - A Quite Comfortable Standard of Living
Considering housing, transportation, food and regular living expenses, 7000 RMB provides for a comfortable monthly lifestyle across much of China, even in top tier cities. Beyond immediate living costs, it allows flexibility to welcome new priorities over time. Public transportation, affordable domestic vehicles, lower housing and food prices seen in smaller cities further boost purchasing power of this salary. With prudent spending, 7000 RMB monthly translates to secure living with extras available today, and resources dedicated to future needs as circumstances change. Overall, a quite comfortable standard of living.
