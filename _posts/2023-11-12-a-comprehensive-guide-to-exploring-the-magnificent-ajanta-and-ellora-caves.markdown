## A Glimpse into Ajanta Caves: Architectural Marvels from the 2nd Century BCE 
The **Ajanta Caves are numbered 30 rock-cut cave monuments** that are carved into a semicircular cliff face. Construction of these **Buddhist monastic complexes** began in the 2nd century BCE and continued until around the 6th century CE. Cave 10, known as the **'Chaitya-griha' or prayer hall cave**, is considered the oldest among them.
What makes Ajanta Caves truly special are the exquisite **frescoes and paintings** that adorn its interiors and date back to the late Gupta period around the 5th century CE. Depicting myriad scenes from the life of Buddha and Jataka tales, these works of art remain unparalleled examples of ancient Indian painting styles like **Ajanta Style**. Among the most famous paintings are those from Cave 1's porch or Cave 17's 'Buddha's Life' depictions. Spending hours taking in these intact colorful frescoes is an experience worth your time.
### Exploring the Finely-Carved Caves

Take your time exploring each numbered **chaitya (prayer hall) and vihara (monastery)** intricately carved from basalt rock face using only hand-held tools. Let the skill of the artisans in **fashioning rock pillars, bed designs, arched gates and stupas** sink in as you wander through these UNESCO-protected marvels.

## Ellora Caves: Where Three Faiths Coexist in Architectural Splendor 
While Ajanta Caves showed the zenith of Buddhist rock-cut architecture, Ellora Caves reveal the syncretism of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism across 30 rock-cut monuments erected between the 6th to 10th centuries CE. These were excavated from Charanandri hills, **just 34km from Aurangabad**.
The most impressive among Ellora's monuments is Cave 16, better known as the **Kailasa Temple**. Carved entirely from a single rock face, it uniquely represents **Shaivism (Shiva worship) in a multi-storey architectural style**. Spread across an area double that of Parthenon, this ***Rathas** or temple-within-a-fortress is counted among the largest monolithic structures globally.
### Discovering Sacred Structures Across Three Faiths
Taking days to explore Ellora's sprawling precincts, you get to experience the influences each religion had on rock-cut cave architecture. From elaborate **Jain Tirthankara sculptures in Caves 8-10** to the earliest **Buddhist structural viharas and chaityas in Caves 12-14**, your journey culminates in the **Kailasa Temple's awe-inspiring multiplicity of shikhara towers, mandapas and sculptures**. Witnessing how three faiths coexisted within a single landmass is sure to leave you with perspectives to last lifetimes.
