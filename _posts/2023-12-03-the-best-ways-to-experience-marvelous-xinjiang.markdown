Known as the "Atlantic Ocean's last teardrop", Sayram Lake presents splendid scenes throughout the year with its surrounding mountains, glaciers, forests, grasslands and lakes.

My parents had immensely enjoyed their multi-trip exploration of Xinjiang through self-driving with local guides. Renting a van allows flexibility to spontaneously experience local life through homestays and discover remote areas not covered by trains. Costs are also lower when shared between friends compared to train fares.

An important Silk Road city with a wonderfully preserved old town, Kashgar presents carvings, patterns and wonders seducing visitors into a tale from One Thousand and One Nights.

Nestled among snow-capped peaks and verdant hills, the stunning Kanas Lake and surrounding sceneries have rightly earned the area the titles of "paradise" and "garden of heaven". 
### Nalati Grassland: A Natural Museum
With a pleasant climate enveloped by mountains, the beautifully named "grassland in heaven" is a showplace of pastoral folk life, memorable herds, and pristine nature.
In summary, **Xinjiang offers world-class options** for travellers to experience its rich landscapes and cultural heritage through safe, luxurious train trips on New Orient Express, flexible road journeys, or iconic natural and historical destinations.
