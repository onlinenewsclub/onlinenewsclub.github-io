### Current Legislation and Categories of Possession  
The current legislation in the Dominican Republic regarding marijuana possession is very strict, no matter the intended use or quantity possessed. There are three categories that determine the potential legal consequences based on the amount found:
- [Simple possession](https://codeces.github.io/2024-01-09-haiti-xdclkesi/): Up to 20 grams is considered simple possession. Even such a small amount risks potential legal troubles.
- **Distributor/seller**: Possessing more than 20 grams but less than one pound (454 grams) is seen as intent to distribute. This middle category faces more serious charges. 
- **Trafficker**: Anyone found in possession of one pound or more of marijuana is classified as a trafficker. This amounts to a criminal offense that carries very heavy penalties, including lengthly prison sentences.

### Enforcement and Risks of Getting Caught
While the laws are strict on paper, enforcement can be less consistent in practice. Much depends on the discretion of local law enforcement. Some reports indicate it may be possible to avoid serious charges for very small amounts if able to pay an "unofficial fine" to officers. However, this route is uncertain and risks further legal issues. The jails in the Dominican Republic are not a place one wants to experience. For tourists and visitors, it is best to avoid all marijuana usage and possession while in the country. Discretion is key to avoiding unwanted encounters with police.
### Common But Low Quality Supply 
Marijuana is a commonly used drug in the Dominican Republic despite its illegality. However, the quality is generally not very high. Much of the supply available is not very potent. Those accustomed to using higher grade cannabis from other places may be disappointed by the options in the DR. The low quality also reinforces that discretion is important, as using in public may draw unwanted attention quicker due to stronger odors released. Sticking to private indoor use helps reduce risks.
### Advice for Visitors Considering Use  
For visitors considering using marijuana while in the Dominican Republic, a few guidelines can help minimize risks:
- **Do not bring your own supply** - Importing any amount risks drug trafficking charges. 
- **Avoid public use at all costs** - Even discreet usage in parks, beaches or similar areas leaves one exposed to onlookers reporting to police. 
- **Only use indoors in a private residence** - Renting an Airbnb or hotel room provides a safer indoor space away from potential issues outside. 
- **Never drive under the influence** - In addition to safety risks, police roadblocks could detect impairment leading to further legal issues. 
- **Keep quantities small** - Possession of just a few grams for personal use poses less risk than larger amounts if encountered by authorities.
- **Assess situations carefully** - Be aware of any signs that indicate a higher likelihood of police presence before making a decision to use. Discretion is key.
Overall, while marijuana usage in the Dominican Republic does occur, visitors must understand both the legal risks and use best discretion possible to avoid drawing unwanted attention from local law enforcement. Following basic guidelines on quantity, location and behavior helps reduce chances of facing the very serious legal penalties under the country's strict possession laws. Tourists are best avoiding partaking given the risks do not outweigh rewards.
### Accounts from Long-Term Users in the Country  
Based on reports from those who have used marijuana in the Dominican Republic more frequently over longer periods of time, discretion truly is the primary factor in avoiding problems with law enforcement:
- Keep quantities small enough to be plausibly for personal use only. 
- Never use in public spaces like beaches where police patrol. Only ever indoors away from potential onlookers.
- Be friendly but avoid using near or interacting with police even when sober. Do not give them any reason to suspect recent or current usage. 
- Higher quality/potency marijuana attracts more attention due to telltale odors carrying farther. Stick to the locally available, lower quality options. 
- Late night hours bring an increased likelihood of police stops and checking for substances like alcohol. Avoid using in evenings and nights out of caution.
For long term residents and locals, small-scale responsible usage can likely occur without issues when following practices to maintain discretion at all times and avoid attracting undue notice. However, visitors face amplified risks that are rarely worth taking given alternatives in home countries. The legal penalties and conditions within Dominican jails are severe deterrents against flouting usage laws.
### Summary
In summary, marijuana is illegal in the Dominican Republic under very strict possession laws. While usage does happen to some degree among locals and long-term foreign residents, discretion is absolutely key to avoiding issues with law enforcement for both small-time possession and general usage. Tourists and travelers have little to gain from the risks involved given the serious criminal charges and potential jail time consequences under the country's categorical possession legislation. Following best practices around quantity, location and behavior helps minimize already existing risks, but discretion remains the watchword for any using marijuana while in the Dominican Republic.
