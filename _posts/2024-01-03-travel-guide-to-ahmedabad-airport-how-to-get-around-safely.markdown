### Transport Options from Ahmedabad Airport
There are several safe and affordable transportation options available when traveling from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad. **Scheduled airport taxis, ride-hailing apps,** and public buses can all provide reliable transport within the city. Airport taxi drivers will be waiting outside the terminal asking passengers if they need a ride. These taxis provide printed receipts and usually charge a fixed round-trip fare. 
Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Ola are also a popular choice for airport transportation. These services offer tracked rides at reasonable rates. Passengers can see fare estimates upfront and track their driver's location for added peace of mind. Lastly, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) operates buses from the airport to various city destinations. Though slower, the AMC buses provide an extremely cost-effective option for under Rs. 10.

### Choosing a Trusted Driver 
While all transport methods are generally safe, it is still best to exercise caution. Travelers should avoid unauthorized rickshaw drivers offering rides outside the terminal. Stick to **pre-booked rides, airport taxis, or AMC buses** where the driver/conductor is accountable. Passengers may feel most secure taking a ride-hailing service like Uber or Ola, as the drivers are verified and trips are tracked electronically. 
The airport taxi booth inside can arrange a licensed cab, but fares tend to be higher. As an alternative,authorized taxi drivers greeting passengers outside offer fair fixed prices. Be sure to confirm the rate with the driver before departing and ask for a printed receipt. Most airport taxis charge round-trip to provide a return for the driver.
### Safety in Ahmedabad City
Safety is generally not a major concern when traveling within Ahmedabad. As one of India's safest large cities, Ahmedabad has strict laws against drinking and related crimes. **Crowded public areas, reliable transport apps, alcohol ban** help provide a secure experience for visitors. Still, common sense precautions like avoiding isolated areas at late hours apply. 
### Getting Around the City
Once in Ahmedabad, there are several intra-city transportation options for travelers to explore the city. Auto-rickshaws are convenient for short distances but negotiate fares upfront. Metro service connects major locations, while city **buses cover wider areas at low fares.** For independent longer trips, renting a car with a driver offers flexibility and safety in an unfamiliar place. Ride-hailing is also reliable for airport transfers or city sightseeing. 
With careful transport choices and basic awareness, visitors can feel secure exploring Ahmedabad. Using reliable pre-booked services tracked electronically provides accountability and peace of mind when traveling from the airport into the city center and for local sightseeing.
