### Penyetan Dishes
Surabaya is renowned for its **penyetan style cuisine**, where proteins and sides are smashed to tender perfection with mortar and pestle. Dishes like penyet iga (pork ribs), penyet ayam (chicken), and penyet bakwan (meatballs) shine with a fiery sambal. For a memorable meal, head to Warung Bu Kris or Léko, masters of penyet iga. Be sure to specify "sambal tidak pedas" if you want a mild version, as the default sambal brings serious heat. The refreshing cucumber and crackling tofu sides balance each bold, savory bite.
### Terang Bulan
More than just a sweet Martabak Manis, Terang Bulan is a savory, flaky pancake sensation. As its name suggests, **"light of the moon"** treats are a late-night staple across Southeast Asia. Surabaya spins creative **Terang Bulan** flavors like Red Velvet, Oreo, and Cream Cheese alongside classics like Chocolate and Cheese. For the authentic experience, hit up Terang Bulan Holland and satisfy your midnight cravings. Whether "basah" (moist) or "garing" (crispy), each bite transports you to sun-drenched street stalls. 
### Surabaya's Heritage Street Food
Beyond the icons, Surabaya dazzles with vibrant street eats. Sample **ketoprak**, a herbacious noodle salad, at Taman Surya. Indulge in **basreng goreng**, flaky fried pastry stewed with jackfruit and palm sugar syrup. Savor **bakso urat**, gelatinous beef meatballs infused with collagen broth. Discover local delicacies at Pasar Besar Indo and Pasar Atom, surrounded by lively commerce. Chat with food patriarchs and uncover flavorful historical **gems off the main strips**.
### Fusion Sweets and Snacks
Modern Surabaya puts inventive spins on classics. In **plaza food courts**, grab **kue putu mangga** (steamed rice cakes with jackfruit and condensed milk) or dodol sawut (semolina candy dotted with peanuts). For coffee, sip house-roasted brews alongside aromatic kue cubit (crispy cookies) and pastel (layered pastry puffs). At Lorong Katong, bakeries craft rainbow pancakes and pandan waffles. Drop by specialty stores for **fusion stuffed cookies** like Mochi and Red Velvet flavors. Surabaya's **sweet tooth** never rests!
### Cultural Heritage District Explorations
Beyond eats, discover Surabaya’s cultural layers. Wander **Kampung Arab**'s narrow lanes for charming homes and a stunning Great Mosque. Stroll **Kampung Belanda**'s tree-lined avenues with architecture from Dutch colonial days. Pay respects at iconic structures like the **Pahlawan Monument**. Take a **free Surabaya Heritage Tour** through the "House of Sampoerna" for guided insights. Between stops, fill up on lively street snacks like cendol and es doger for optimal exploration energy.
