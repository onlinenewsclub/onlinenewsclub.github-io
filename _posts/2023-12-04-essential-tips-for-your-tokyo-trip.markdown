### Comfortable Shoes Are a Must
As one of the world's most walkable cities, you'll be doing a lot of sightseeing on foot in Tokyo. Be sure to pack comfortable, well-broken-in shoes that won't cause blisters. While sneakers may be tempting, lug-soled shoes provide traction on sidewalks and subway stairs. Take new shoes for a test drive [before your trip](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-04-u53cc-u76ee-u89c2-u89c8-u5df4-u62ff-u9a6c-u8fd0-u6cb3/) to ensure they feel good for all-day exploring. Blisters and sore feet can seriously dampen the fun of discovering Tokyo's neighborhoods.

### Opt for Neutral Clothing in Warm Weather
If you want to blend in with locals, keep your warm-weather wardrobe simple with colors like black, navy, tan, and white. These basic hues allow you to **avoid standing out as a tourist**. In summer, men are better off in long pants rather than shorts. For women, **Japanese fashion trends** lean toward modesty, so you may not see locals in shorts or sleeveless tops. Light, comfortable fabrics let you enjoy the sights without worrying about sun exposure. Guys can wear shorts if they don't mind **instant tourist recognition**! 
### Convenience Stores Are Constant Companions
Thanks to the ubiquitous 7-Eleven, Lawson, and FamilyMart stores, you'll never be far from a **restroom, snacks, drinks, or ATM**. Stock up on bottled drinks, onigiri rice balls, sandwiches, and more for picnic lunches or snacks on long sightseeing days. Use the ATMs inside for yen, as 7-Eleven machines don't charge foreign transaction fees. You'll also find toiletries, phone chargers, and even luggage you forgot at these amazing **“conbinis.”** 
### Easily Navigate with Basic Japanese Phrases
While many Tokyo residents speak excellent English, not everyone can. Learn a few key phrases like "Excuse me, do you speak English?" and "Where is the station?" to get directions or assistance. Better yet, use popular translation apps to type what you need. Locals will appreciate any effort to communicate, even if your Japanese is **poorly pronounced**! A smile and polite body language can also help bridge language barriers.
### Respect Japanese Etiquette Everywhere You Go 
Always remove your shoes when entering homes, temples, and many businesses. This is standard Japanese etiquette to keep places clean. Keep your voice down on trains and in public—loud conversations disturb others. Don't eat or drink while walking. Be on time for appointments and dinner reservations. And remember, tipping is unnecessary—great **customer service is expected,** not an extra reward. By observing these social norms, you show respect for Japanese culture on your trip.
### Dining Out is a Delight in Japan  
With such incredible quality and variety even at family restaurants and bento box shops, you may wonder why anyone dines at pricey venues. The simple answer is ambience—finer establishments offer nicer surroundings to enjoy top-notch cuisine. But dining is such an art form in Japan that the food quality difference between a ramen shop and high-end kaiseki is **marginal at best**. Budget travelers can eat amazingly well just by browsing konbini offerings or hitting trending ramen spots. No tipping required anywhere!
### Experience Convenient and Fast Public Transport
Getting around Tokyo is easy thanks to the extensive train and subway network. Station maps and signs are highly visually intuitive, even for non-Japanese speakers. Commuters include live train arrival times and service changes to plan journeys efficiently. For adventurous types, hopping on random lines opens surprising discoveries. Avoid peak rush hours if you hate crowds, but also don't miss the spectacle of packed stations like Shinjuku. Factor in travel times between areas, as distances can be deceiving in the huge metropolitan sprawl. 
### Explore Beyond the Mega-City of Tokyo
While the bustling capital offers endless attractions, don't overlook trips outside city limits. Cities like nearby Kyoto preserve more traditional culture. Osaka is known for delicious street food and nightlife. Rural areas display natural beauty and historic sites far from city crowds and rules. Places like Hakone showcase onsen hot springs surrounded by forests and lakes. For a completely different Japan experience, renting a car lets you set your own adventure pace on remote islands or along coastal roads.
### Immerse in Unique Japanese Traditions
Besides international attractions, seek out cultural gems like festivals, temples, gardens, and seasonal events celebrating local customs. Experience majestic sunrises over shrines like Fushimi Inari during your Tokyo trip. Don't miss centuries-old traditions like tea ceremonies demonstrating Japanese hospitality or demonstrations of arts like origami andcalligraphy. Connecting with history through traditions, not just sightseeing landmarks, offers richer cultural understanding during foreign travels. Whether in major cities or smaller towns, Japan's traditions never cease to inspire awe. 
### Embrace the Unexpected in Charming Japan
Despite its huge scale and rapid modernization, Tokyo retains an ineffable charming atmosphere everywhere you go. Smiling faces, pristine streets without litter, and little inconveniences becoming triumphs of efficiency give the city an aura impossible to find elsewhere. Let go of expectations and immerse yourself here without judgments. Life's small surprises around each corner, from vending machine sweets to neon robot restaurants, highlight Japan's ability to marry innovation with refinement. Your Tokyo experience will stay with you through its ability to constantly surprise and lift your spirits every day.
