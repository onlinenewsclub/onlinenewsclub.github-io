### Early Days as the Capital of Selangor
Kuala Lumpur began as a small gold mining town in the 1860s along the Klang River in what was then part of the state of Selangor. Due to its strategic location by the river, it soon grew into an important commercial center and became the capital of Selangor in 1871. **Selangor state capital city.** For over a century, Kuala Lumpur served as both the economic and political center of Selangor. Many places still share names between Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, reflecting this early history when they were more closely linked administratively.

### Emergence as a Unique Federal Territory 
In 1972, Kuala Lumpur was officially granted city status, the first settlement in Malaysia to receive this designation after independence. Just two years later in 1974, a major reorganization took place when Kuala Lumpur was separated out to become a unique [federal territory Kuala Lumpur administration](https://thetopnews.github.io/understanding-the-wireless-communication-of-the-original-xbox-360-controller/). Administered directly by the federal government rather than any state authority, the boundaries of Kuala Lumpur as a federal territory also expanded substantially beyond the original city limits. This cemented its position as the preeminent urban center and brought it fully under national leadership.
### Local Governance through Kuala Lumpur City Hall
As a federal territory, Kuala Lumpur is not part of any state and local governance is handled through the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, also known as DBKL. The mayor who heads DBKL is appointed by the federal government itself rather than being elected. Citizens of Kuala Lumpur are represented politically through members of parliament but do not have a voice at the state territorial level. **DBKL governance Kuala Lumpur administration**. DBKL oversees essential municipal services as well as long-term urban planning and development for the territory.
### Evolution of the Landscape and Skyline
In the decades since becoming a federal territory, Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid modernization and urbanization. Ambitious development projects have radically transformed the cityscape, especially in the downtown core. Iconic skyscrapers now dominate the horizon where once there were just rural villages. **Transformation Kuala Lumpur skyline development**.

The federal territory acts as a magnet attracting people from all over the country and beyond. **Kuala Lumpur diversity demographics**. Its renowned cityscape, world-class amenities and thriving economy have long cemented Kuala Lumpur as the pulsating heart of multicultural Malaysia where people from many different ethnicities and backgrounds live and work together in harmony. This cultural richness and vibrancy have been key to powering Kuala Lumpur's continued success.
### Ongoing Development as a World-Class Urban Center  
As it commemorates nearly 150 years since its founding, Kuala Lumpur faces the ongoing challenge of balancing progress with heritage as one of Asia's premier cities. **Kuala Lumpur sustainable development challenges**. Cutting-edge plans like the massive Bandar Malaysia redevelopment testify to the city's ambition for the future.
