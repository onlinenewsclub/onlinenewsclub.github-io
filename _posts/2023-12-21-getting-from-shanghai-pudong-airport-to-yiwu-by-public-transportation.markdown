### # Consider Your Transportation Options
When arriving late at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, you'll want to carefully consider the best transportation options to continue your journey to Yiwu. Here are some key factors to weigh:
- The last metro train departed around midnight, so taking the subway is not an option. 
- Airport shuttle buses to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport generally start running around 7 AM, too late if you land at midnight. 
- Taxis can be an expensive option over long distances like from Pudong Airport to downtown Shanghai stations.
- **High-speed rail** is usually the most convenient public transportation from Shanghai to Yiwu once you reach a major station, but you'll need to get there first.
Let's explore the most viable itinerary options factoring in timing, cost, and ease of transferring between modes of transportation.

### Taking a Taxi or Airport Shuttle to Hongqiao Station 
One option is to take a taxi or airport shuttle bus directly to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station for around 100-150 RMB, allowing you to then catch one of the frequent high-speed trains to Yiwu. Though taxis will cost more than shuttles, they provide a more flexible arrival time since shuttles only run starting at 7 AM. 
Upon arriving at Hongqiao Station, you can purchase tickets for the next available G-train, with the earliest departure around 6:20 AM, arriving in Yiwu in under 2 hours. **High-speed rail** is by far the quickest public transit from Shanghai.
### Alternative: South Station via Taxi or Metro
If the timing doesn't work out for shuttles or late night taxis to Hongqiao Station, another viable option is to take a taxi or the metro to Shanghai South Railway Station instead. From Pudong Airport, the metro takes around 1.5 hours for only 9 RMB to reach South Station versus 1 hour by taxi for around 187 RMB. 
From South Station, several direct trains also run daily to Yiwu, albeit taking 2-3 hours versus high-speed rail's 90 minutes. The additional travel time is a tradeoff for having more transportation options late at night from the airport.
### Plan Ahead to Catch Early Trains 
Whichever station you ultimately end up at in Shanghai, your goal should be to arrive in time to catch one of the early morning trains to Yiwu. The first departures are generally around 6:20-7 AM, allowing you to reach your destination city before noon. Arriving late at night, be sure to account for transit times and walking distances between connecting legs of the journey. With proper advance planning, any of these public transit options can get you to Yiwu within a single day.
