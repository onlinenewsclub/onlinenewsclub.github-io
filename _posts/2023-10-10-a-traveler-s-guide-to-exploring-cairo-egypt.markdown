## Safety Tips for Visiting Cairo
Here are some tips to stay safe while visiting Cairo, Egypt's vibrant capital city.
### Dress Appropriately 
While Egypt is generally very welcoming to foreign visitors, it's a conservative Muslim society. **To avoid unwanted attention in some areas, dress modestly** - opt for pants or long skirts instead of shorts, and avoid low-cut tops. Loose, lightweight fabrics are best for coping with Cairo's hot climate. Keep expensive jewelry and flashy accessories at home or out of sight. Dressing respectfully helps you attract less attention and blend in.

### Stay in Groups in Tourist Areas
Some heavily touristed sites like the [Great Pyramids of Giza](https://thetopnews.github.io/ray-tracing-revealed-the-path-to-photorealism-in-games/) can attract persistent souvenir sellers and guides. To avoid hassle, **stick close to your travel group or hire an accredited guide**. Tour operators also offer security - they know which areas are safe and how to politely deflect unwanted attention. Walking alone makes you a potential target for scams or harassment, no matter your gender. 
### Only Use Licensed Money Changers
Ignore street money changers and only exchange cash at **licensed money exchange offices** found around Cairo, especially in major hotels. They offer fair exchange rates without risk of getting scammed. Also have some small bills to break large notes if needed. 
### Plan Your Itinerary in Advance
With some planning, you can enjoy Cairo safely on your own. Use this guide to help you map out top attractions to visit based on your interests like **ancient Egyptian history, Islamic architecture or evening entertainment**. Book any activities requiring guides or contexts in good time. Flexibility is still wise in case of disruptions.
### Budget Appropriately for Expenses
A daily budget of $75-100 USD will cover moderate lodging, local transport, meals and entry fees during your Cairo visit. Note prices may fluctuate. Save money by eating **authentic Egyptian street food** instead of pricier tourist restaurants. Tipping is expected and rates are reasonable, so bring some small bills. 
## Top Things to See and Do in Cairo
