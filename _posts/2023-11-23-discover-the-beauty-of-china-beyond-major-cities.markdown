China is a vast country with a rich history and culture spanning across many regions. While major cities like Beijing and Shanghai receive most of the international visitors, there are many hidden gems outside of them waiting to be explored. This guide will introduce some of the top scenic spots in lesser known but equally beautiful places in China.
### Experience Majestic Karst Landscapes in Guilin
Located in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guilin is renowned for its breathtaking [karst mountain scenery](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-09-la-maur-xe9tanie-romaine/). Standing on one of the many hills surrounding the city at sunset, you will be amazed by the picturesque silhouettes of the limestone peaks emerging in vivid colors as the sun goes down. Instead of following the tourist crowds, venture out into the countryside to hike through lesser visited karst formations or fish with local villagers by the Li River. On a rainy day, visit local tea farmers in their homes to sample fresh tea leaves plucked straight from the bushes. The relaxed pace of life and stunning natural landscapes make Guilin a refreshingly unique destination.

### Admire Ancient Architecture in provincial Capital Nanchang
While not as famous internationally, the capital city of Jiangxi province - Nanchang, has a rich cultural heritage of its own. Home to historical landmarks like the ornate **Teng Wang Pavilion** built in the Tang dynasty, it gives visitors a glimpse into traditional Chinese architectural and artistic styles. For a modern attraction, head to Qiushui Square, where a nightly sound and light show is projected onto massive water fountains accompanied by music. Nature lovers can also escape to tranquil scenic areas within an hour's drive, such as colorful rock formations in Meiling or refreshing lakes surrounded by bamboo forests. With recently improved infrastructure, Nanchang has become more accessible for exploring Jiangxi's vibrant history and scenery.
### Marvel at Spectacular Geologic Formations in Zhangjiajie 
Rising abruptly from the rolling hills of northern Hunan lies one of China's most unique landscapes - **Zhangjiajie National Forest Park**. Towering sandstone pillars resembling lofty skyscrapers emerge from the dense forests below. Wandering along suspended pathways winding through and between the pillars give a sense of being in a prehistoric forest climbing amongst giants. At night, the pillars are illuminated with vibrant colored lights enhancing the otherworldly atmosphere. Less than three hours by high-speed rail from Xiangtan or Changsha, Zhangjiajie makes for an ideal short break destination surrounded by nature's beauty unlike anywhere else in the world.
### Find Inner Peace in Longevity Village Bama 
Venture further into Guangxi past poetic river towns to discover an oasis of wellness - the **Longevity Village Bama**. Nestled in lush karst mountains, the village is home to the Yao ethnic minority renowned for their longevity. Follow their healthy lifestyle philosophy by waking up at dawn for tai chi practice and enjoying homegrown tea or locally harvested vegetables and mushrooms. Spend afternoons meditating in ancient temples or taking leisurely strolls through villages dotted with wind and rain bridges. Absorbing the calm pace and clean mountain air activities are perfectly balanced with spiritual nourishment for rejuvenating both body and soul.
### Experience Cosmopolitan Energy in Shanghai
For a vibrant modern Chinese city experience, look no further than Shanghai. As China's most globalized metropolis, Shanghai offers world-class attractions from the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower to the futuristic skyline of Pudong across the Huangpu River. Wander along the Bund for grand European colonial architecture overlooking the river or get a taste of traditional arts and crafts at Yuyuan Garden. After dark, catch a dazzling acrobatic performance followed by sampling Shanghai's legendary cuisine from delicate xiaolongbao dumplings to mouthwatering hairy crabs. With abundant accommodation and transport options, Shanghai serves as a perfect gateway into China.
### Marvel at Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an
Steeped in historical significance, Xi'an was the starting point of the ancient Silk Road and capital of 13 dynasties including Han and Tang. Chief among its attractions is the UNESCO World Heritage Site - the Terracotta Army. Designed to protect China's first Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the afterlife, over 8,000 life-size figures were sculpted from thousands of ceramic molds and remain impressively preserved to this day. Equally worth exploring are the city's medieval Muslim Quarter for exotic Central Asian influenced architecture and flavorful cuisine. Wandering along South Gate to watch kite and puppetry shows gives a glimpse into daily local life in this friendly northern city. While less hectic than other destinations, Xi'an rewards visitors with a rich cultural experience. 
### Explore UNESCO Heritage Rice Terraces
Venturing further west in Yunnan and Guangxi, one can discover some of China's most scenic and lesser visited regions. Towering layers of immaculately terraced hillsides sheltered by lush tropical greenery is the hallmark of Longji and Yangshuo's famous rice terraces. Completely harmonized with nature through generations of cultivation, they offer photographers breathtaking panoramic vistas. Trek along the terraces' stone pathways for magnificent views or glide slowly by boat down the lazy Li River taking in the picturesque scenery. Simple village homestays allow fully immersing in rural life providing a refreshing escape from modern amenities. Journeying through these stunning **UNESCO World Heritage Sites** offers insight into southern China's unique landscapes and culture far from the crowds.
### Experience UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in Fujian
Hugging China's southeastern coastline lies Fujian province renowned for preserving diverse traditional folk arts. On the Min River delta, Quanzhou served as an important port city along the Maritime Silk Road introducing global connections since ancient times. Venture to coastal towns and villages to discover rich **intangible cultural heritage performances and crafts** such as intricate paper-cuttings, shadow puppet plays, opera singing and colorful ceremonial gown embroidery. Participate in lively folk festivals, learn techniques from inheritors of intangible cultural heritage or sample the distinct Teochew cuisine. Fujian's mild climate and vibrant cultural roots provide ample inspiration and creative stimulation through centuries-preserved folkways.
I hope this guide has introduced some of the hidden gems of natural and cultural beauty beyond the most popular tourist cities in China. With high-speed rail networks rapidly expanding regional access, exploring lesser known places offers travelers unique experiences of local lifestyles intertwined with stunning scenery not seen anywhere else in the world. While a single lifetime may not suffice to discover everything uniquely wonderful in vast and diverse China, venturing off the beaten track rewards adventurous spirits with unearthed treasures at every turn.
