### Checking the Postage Rates
Postage rates in the US are determined by the US Postal Service and can change periodically. To mail a regular letter within the US, the current postage rate is 55 cents. A regular letter is defined as a mail piece that is less than 1 ounce in weight, between 3-1/2′′ to 6-1/8′′ high and 5′′ to 11-1/2′′ long, and less than 1/4′′ thick.
The postcard stamp is currently priced at 35 cents each by the US Postal Service. Therefore, if two postcard stamps with a total value of 70 cents (2 x 35 cents) are used, it would exceed the minimum postage requirement of 55 cents to mail a regular letter domestically in the US.

### Paying a Little Extra Doesn't Hurt Convenience
Using two 35-cent postcard stamps that are worth 70 cents in total to mail a regular letter would result in overpaying the postage by 15 cents. While this is more than what is needed, some people may find this convenient rather than having to buy a book of first-class stamps. The extra 15 cents paid offers the benefit of being able to mail the letter immediately without requiring a trip to the post office or online purchase of correct postage.

### Metered Mail Offers a Lower Rate Option
For businesses that send out large mail volumes regularly, using a postage meter can provide a more cost-effective solution than individual stamps. Metered mail qualifies for a lower postage rate of 50 cents for a regular letter within the US. This rate is 5 cents lower than the 55 cent regular first-class stamp rate. However, there is an additional upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs associated with rental or purchase of a postage meter. The lower rate only applies to mail pieces with accurate and validated meter imprints. **metered mail postage discount**
### Math Never Lies - The Numbers Support Using Two Postcard Stamps
Doing the simple math confirms that two 35-cent postcard stamps add up to 70 cents, which exceeds the minimum 55 cent domestic regular letter rate set by the USPS. While overpaying by 15 cents, posting with two postcard stamps functionally meets the postage requirement. Some may argue the 15 cent overpayment is well worth the convenience and avoiding a special trip to purchase a book of first-class stamps for a single letter. The numbers don't lie - two postcard stamps getting the job done, as long as you don't mind a small premium for the added convenience. **postage math postcard stamps**
### Summary
In summary, using two 35-cent postcard stamps that are worth a total of 70 cents would be sufficient to mail a regular letter within the US, since it exceeds the minimum 55 cent requirement. While a small convenience fee is incurred via overpayment of 15 cents, this method allows mailing the letter immediately without needing to procure exact postage. Alternative options like metered mail can offer lower postage rates at the expense of upfront equipment costs for higher volume mailers. Ultimately, the postage rates and math check out to support using two postcard stamps for mailing regular letters domestically when needed for convenience.
