## **Getting Around Barcelona on the T-10 Card**
One of the most important tips for visiting Barcelona is to purchase a T-10 card from any metro station. The T-10 card allows you to take 10 rides on the metro, bus or tram for just over $15 USD, making it by far the cheapest way to get around the city. As you explore the many wonderful neighborhoods and attractions Barcelona has to offer, the metro is an easy and affordable option. Be sure to validate your T-10 card each time you board by tapping it on the card reader. 
## **Exploring Gracia and Gaudi's Iconic Buildings** 
One of the best neighborhoods to start your Barcelona adventure is **Gracia**. Full of charming plazas and narrow streets, Gracia feels less touristy than other central areas. Be sure to locate all the squares on your map and spend time wandering through this lovely district. As you exit Gracia, you'll pass two of architect Antoni Gaudi's most famous residential buildings - **La Pedrera** and **Casa Batlló**. Both offer tours of Gaudi's innovative interior designs, though they can be pricey. Still, they provide a glimpse into the artistic vision of Barcelona's master builder.  
## **Strolling Along the Iconic Ramblas**
Continue your walk towards the bustling **Plaça de Catalunya**, the city's main hub. From here, head down the legendary **Las Ramblas**, one of Europe's most famous pedestrian boulevards. Lined with flower stalls, street performers and tourist shops, Las Ramblas offers prime people watching. Just be aware that the restaurants along the avenue cater mostly to visitors and aren't always the best quality. A better dining option is to wander the side streets in the **Barri Gotic** neighborhood nearby. Be sure to also check out the charming **Plaça Reial** square along your Ramblas stroll.
## **Taking in Sea Views from the Barceloneta Beach Promenade** 
For a scenic walking route with breathtaking waterfront views, head to the **Diagonal Mar** area via metro or tram. From there, follow the wide promenade along the **Barceloneta Beach** all the way into the city center - a 5km walk each way. The first half of the promenade feels peaceful and residential, giving you a glimpse into local life. Closer to the lively **Port Olimpic**, you'll find packed seafood restaurants and chiringuitos (beach bars). Finish your day unwinding in the charming backstreets of historic **La Barceloneta** neighborhood nearby.  
## **Hiking in Collserola Natural Park**
For fresh air and green space, venture to **Collserola Natural Park** above the city. Take the metro to Peu del Funicular station and board the funicular up to the middle stop, **Passeig de les Aigües**. Follow the wide trail along the ridge for spectacular views of Barcelona and the coastline. You can also observe joggers powering up the park's hilly trails. The two hour loop up to Vallvidrera station offers varied scenery, from Mediterranean bushes to oak forests. Get lost in nature just 30 minutes from the bustling city center.
## **Visiting Gaudi's Masterpiece - La Sagrada Familia** 
No Barcelona trip is complete without seeing Antoni Gaudi's unfinished but iconic basilica, **La Sagrada Familia**. While there can be long queues to enter, it's worth at least exploring the awe-inspiring exterior. Standing amidst the soaring spires and sculptures is a memorable experience. Consider arriving early or later in the day when lines may be shorter. Don't forget to look up - Gaudi's attention to detail extends many stories high. Though incomplete, La Sagrada Familia is Barcelona's most famous landmark and a testament to one man's brilliant and bizarre artistic vision.
## **Discovering the Charming Neighborhoods of El Born and La Ribera**
Venture beyond the busy Gothic Quarter to less touristy El Born and La Ribera neighborhoods in the historic center. El Born, home to the **Picasso Museum**, has chic shops and tapas bars in its narrow lanes. Meanwhile La Ribera, north of El Born, maintains an authentic local vibe. Browse the stalls at the **Santa Caterina Market** then stroll the picturesque streets, taking in architectural gems like Gothic palaces and Renaissance churches. The area around the **Palace of Catalan Music** is also delightful. These neighborhoods offer a glimpse into Barcelona life away from the crowds. 
## **Escaping to the Beach Town of Sitges**
For a change of scenery, take a 40-minute train ride south to the charming seaside town of **Sitges**. Filled with slender bay windows, shady plazas and a picturesque promenade, Sitges exudes Mediterranean grace. Wander the steep lanes, pop into art galleries and churches, then relax at a beachside chiringuito with seafood paella and sangria. In the evening, dine along the waterfront and catch stunning views of the twinkling town. Sitges offers a welcome escape from Barcelona in a postcard-perfect beach town that feels a world away. The train back to the city departs throughout the evening.
## **Spending Five Unforgettable Days in Madrid** 
After a week exploring Barcelona, it's time to continue your Spanish journey in the vibrant capital city of Madrid. Spend your first day wandering the grand boulevards of the **Paseo de la Castellana** and **Paseo del Prado**, taking in iconic sights like the **Royal Palace** and **Royal Botanical Garden**. Next, marvel at works by Spanish masters El Greco, Goya, Velázquez and more at the renowned **Prado Museum**. Budget an entire afternoon to see its treasures. The third day is perfect for shopping in the **Salamanca District**, people watching at **Plaza Mayor**, and roaming the buzzing bars of **La Latina** at night. Day four should be reserved for the stunning **Temple of Debod**, followed by drinks at the **Gran Via** and tapas in **Malasaña**. End your Madrid trip relaxing in the **Retiro Park** and soaking in the regal atmosphere one last time before high-tailing it to the airport for your flight home - with memories to last a lifetime of your incredible Spanish adventure in Barcelona and Madrid!
