### Why China?  
As a foreigner working in China for several years now, I've come to realize that living in China is a truly amazing experience. At first, like many Westerners, I had my doubts and prejudices. But visiting different parts of the country and interacting with local people has completely changed my perspective. China offers safety, affordable cost of living, convenient infrastructure, and rich cultural experiences - some of the key reasons I've come to enjoy living here.

### A Safe and Peaceful Life
Living in China has been incredibly peaceful. I never worry about my personal safety or disruption to daily work - something many large Western cities can't guarantee. [safe living conditions](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-11-14-discovering-the-hidden-gems-of-sardinia/) are a real privilege. As a diabetic, the stable environment and accessibility of healthcare has also provided reassurance during the pandemic. Hospitals are widely available across Chinese cities. Overall, the harmony and stability of life in China has been a welcome change.
### Affordable Living on a Modest Budget  
On a monthly budget of just RMB 5,000 (~$700), I've been able to maintain a good quality of life with no financial stress. This level of affordable living would be difficult even in less expensive parts of the USA or Europe. Expenses like rent, food and transportation are extremely reasonable in China. As an expat from a country with a tax treaty, I've also benefitted from tax exemptions. The low cost of living has allowed me to truly embrace cultural experiences without worrying excessively about money.
### Convenient Infrastructure and Cashless Payments
World-class infrastructure like high-speed rail, modern metros, bike-sharing, and efficient wifi extend across Chinese cities. Paying for goods and services rarely requires cash - I simply scan QR codes using mobile payment apps like WeChat Pay or Alipay. Free deliveries are also standard for online purchases. This level of digitization and convenience rivals and even surpasses Western nations in some aspects. 
### A Bounty of Delicious, Affordable Food
As a self-confessed foodie, discovering regional Chinese cuisines has been a highlight. Local specialties like dumplings, noodles and fresh produce deliver abundant flavors. Best of all, meal costs are exceptionally low - 20 dumplings for just RMB 15! Even home cooking remains very affordable in China. The variety and value of Chinese food is unbeatable.
### Online Shopping Emporium and Cultural Exchanges
Platforms like Taobao offer seemingly endless options for online purchases. Browsing creative handmade goods and discovering lesser known brands has become a daily habit. I've also found the Chinese people to be extremely hospitable - locals enthusiastically share their culture and language. Living immersed in Mandarin provides the perfect environment for accelerating my language skills. Cultural exchanges in China feel warm and enriching.
### Natural Beauty Beyond Cityscapes  
While modern cities dominate popular impressions, natural attractions showcase China's pristine landscapes. The water town of **Zhouzhuang** charmed with its canals and architecture. Heights of **Zhangjiajie** simply leave one in awe of sandstone pillars emerging from misty valleys. China's unspoiled natural reserves like **Huangshan** and **Jiuzhaigou** fill me with gratitude for their preservation. Beyond bustling streets lies a scenic country worthy of exploration.
### An Evolving Nation of Progress and Prosperity
Overall, China has undoubtedly progressed rapidly on all fronts. Constant improvements in environmental protections and greater affluence indicate China's steadfast development. Western views often underestimate the pace of change. Living here grants a front-row view of China's ascent unmatched by brief visits. Though challenges remain, China's resilience and vision for the future inspire confidence. The opportunity to witness historic transformations firsthand continues motivating my stay in this fascinating nation.
In conclusion, living in China as a foreigner offers immense cultural, economic and personal benefits. Preconceptions rarely align with reality on the ground. Beyond prejudgments, an open and appreciative mindset finds much to value in the Chinese way of life. I feel fortunate to experience this period of China's development while maintaining a comfortable standard of living. For these reasons, China will certainly remain my home away from home for years to come. The journey of discovery here feels far from over.
