## Route Through West Texas
### Stepping into the Great Plains
The first recommended route takes you west on [US Route 287](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-07-un-s-xe9jour-de-r-xeave-xe0-belize/) through northern Texas. Passing through Wichita Falls and Amarillo, you'll drive across the flat expanses of the Llano Estacado region. This is classic west Texas ranch country, with **vast pastures dotted with cattle**. Traveling at a leisurely pace allows time to spot **cowboy hats on the horizon** and waves from the occasional pickup truck. 
As you continue north on US Route 287, it merges with US Route 87 heading into New Mexico. The landscape slowly transitions, with taller grasses and scrub brush creeping in among the cattle. Dumas and Dalhart mark the final Texas towns before crossing the state line near **historic Route 66**.

### Crossing into the Land of Enchantment 
Entering New Mexico, US Route 87 and US Route 64 run concurrently northeast towards Clayton. Along this stretch, rocky buttes emerge above the plains in the distance. Soon, mountains rise all around as you find yourself amid the **rugged badlands** of northeastern New Mexico. 
Near Clayton, the Eklund Hotel provides a charming overnight stop with period furnishings and hospitality. After a restful night, resume your journey north on US Route 87. Rolling hills dotted with prairie dogs and cattle rise on the horizon. The wide-open skies showcase dazzling sunrises and sunsets over this remote corner of the state.
## The Mysteries of Capulin Volcano
### An Ancient Reminder of Geologic Forces
A worthwhile detour awaits those traveling the US Route 87 corridor. Just east of Capulin lies **Capulin Volcano National Monument**, a frozen bubble of lava stone towering above the surrounding plains. For a small fee, visitors can drive up the winding road to take in panoramic views from the mountain's rim. 
At the top, remnants of the volcano's perfectly conical shape remain intact over 60,000 years after its violent eruption. Interpretive signs explain how the rising magma carved out the enormous caldera visible below. Witnessing nature's relentless sculpting power offers perspective on humanity's place within deep time. 
### Trails Through a Petrified Forest
Backtracking south leads to a network of short hiking trails weaving among the volcano's outer ridges. Moss-covered cinder cones, cracked basalt boulders, and **petrified lava fragments** remind visitors that volcanic events shaped this entire landscape eons ago. Looking closely, crystal shapes and air bubble patterns emerge within the volcanic rock's dark patina. 
The remoteness of Capulin Volcano enhances its appeal as a destination off the beaten path. With minimal facilities but awe-inspiring natural scenery, it serves as a fitting rest stop along the drive to Colorado's mountains. Its geological mysteries will linger in travelers' memories long after departing its peculiar setting.
## Mountains on the Horizon
### Approaching Raton Pass
Continuing north out of Capulin, US Route 87 traces the northeastern plains as they gradually rise towards mountain-studded skies. Ranch homes and red-rock mesas begin to dot the changing terrain around Raton, New Mexico close to the Colorado border. 
Here, you'll join Interstate 25 northwards - your final leg towards Denver. I-25 traverses **Raton Pass**, climbing through forests of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees into the high country. Evergreen-covered slopes climb dramatically on either side of the highway, revealing yourself steadily gaining elevation with each mile. 
### Descending into the Denver Metro 
After cresting Raton Pass, I-25 begins its gradual descent into northeast Colorado. Golden aspens and maples accent the mountainsides each fall when changing foliage paints the landscape in vibrant oranges, reds and yellows. 
As the interstate unwind towards Colorado Springs and Denver, front ranges laden with mining ghost towns come into view. The urban areas in this corridor have grown enormously but remnants of the **Colorado Gold Rush** survive. Arriving in Denver, revel in accomplished such a scenic cross-country adventure through the heart of the American Southwest.
## Comparing Alternative Routes
### The Open Plains of I-70
An alternative involves taking Interstate 35 from Dallas through Oklahoma City to Wichita, Kansas, then Interstate 135 connecting to Interstate 70. While very direct, this route spans mostly flat, agricultural terrain along congested interstates. 
I-70 itself traverses eastern Colorado and Kansas, offering little variation in landscape aside from **rolling wheat fields and cattle farms**. Some sections prone to high winds can see intermittent closures. Overall it presents few opportunities to stop and appreciate dramatic scenery.
### Construction and Traffic on I-25 
Staying closer to the Front Range, another choice follows Interstate 25 north from Pueblo. However, heavy traffic congestion occurs through Colorado Springs, Castle Rock and Denver's southern suburbs. Construction projects often cause delays, especially during summer travel seasons.
While offering urban amenities nearer by, this route provides minimal opportunities to disconnect from bustle and immerse in nature. Its mountain and prairie attractions feel obscured while navigating multi-lane highways.
## Conclusion: The Ideal Rocky Mountain Adventure
For those seeking an unhurried, scenic road trip experience amid the American Southwest's diverse landscapes, following US 287 to Raton Pass proves the most rewarding. Its small towns, big skies, volcanic anomalies and majestic mountain vistas create a true sense of exploration little matched by congested interstates.
With advance trip planning using detail maps, comfortable driving between highlights and an openness to serendipitous discoveries, this route cultivates lasting impressions of the natural beauty found along the journey from Dallas to Denver. Its diverse scenery, outdoor recreation sites and cultural history will not soon fade from your travels' cherished memories.
