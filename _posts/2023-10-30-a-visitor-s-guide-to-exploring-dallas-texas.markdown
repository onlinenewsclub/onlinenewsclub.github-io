### Getting Around by Public Transit
Public transit is a convenient way to explore the many attractions around Dallas. **The Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART)** system includes rail and bus services that can take you to key destinations throughout the city. While not as extensive as large transit systems in other major cities, DART is a reliable and affordable option for getting around Dallas. 
The light rail runs right by the Convention Center and is one of the best ways to access major areas of downtown like the [West End Entertainment District](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-ub791-uc2a4-ub530-uc639-ube44-uc5e5-uc5d0-uc11c-uc758-uc5ec-ud589-uacbd-ud5d8/) and the many world-class **museums and attractions** in the vicinity such as the acclaimed **Perot Museum of Natural Science**. For just $5, you can purchase an all-day pass and take the light rail north, east, west, or south to various neighborhoods and suburbs around the city. Be sure to use the DART website or mobile app to plan your routes and check schedules in advance.
