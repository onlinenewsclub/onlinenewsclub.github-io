## Transportation around Bangkok
### [Getting around the city via public transport](https://northtimes.github.io/2024-01-08-u30bb-u30fc-u30b7-u30a7-u30eb-u3067-u306e-u751f-u6d3b/)
Bangkok has an excellent public transportation system that locals rely on daily. The BTS Skytrain and MRT subway lines provide an air-conditioned way to beat the heat and traffic as they connect most major shopping and tourist areas. Fares range from 15-50THB depending on distance. For longer journeys, the public buses are another affordable option starting at just 7-9THB per ride. Downloading the transit apps ** Bangkok BTS, MRT, Bus** will help navigate schedules and routes with ease.

### **Exploring neighborhoods by Tuk Tuk or boat** 
While taxis can be expensive, hiring a **Tuk Tuk driver for half or full day** is a fun local experience. You'll ride past sights while listening to the driver's stories. Another unique way to see the city is by taking the **Chao Phraya Express Boat**. The routes go up and down the river connecting major stops like Tha Saphan Taksin, Phra Arthit, and Sathorn Pier. Simply purchase a ticket and enjoy the breezy views.
## Accommodation for every budget
### **Staying in a charming boutique hotel**
For those seeking more character than large chains, Bangkok has charming boutique options. The **Willow Guesthouse** in old town is set in renovated Thai houses and offers nice rooms from just over $25. **Chillout Hostel** near Khao San Road combines dorms and privates with a pool and bar area perfect for socializing. Another top pick is the **Feung Nakorn Balcony** , an art hotel located in a restored shophouse.
### **"Going local" at a guesthouse or hostel** 
If really wanting to experience Thai culture first hand, stay at a guesthouse. The **Suneta Hostel Khao San** has been family run for decades and offers spacious dorms as well as shared kitchen. Nearby, **NapPark Hostel** is set in a refurbished old building and has a lively communal atmosphere. Further out, **Oldtown Hostel** placed in wooden buildings provides a quieter stay in Bangkok's Chinatown. 
## Exploring Bangkok's main attractions
### **Visiting grand heritage sites in the Old City**
No trip is complete without seeing Bangkok's impressive landmarks. A must is the **Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew)**, part of the expansive Grand Palace complex. For spectacular architecture blended with history, visit the nearby **Wat Pho** temple, home to a giant reclining Buddha. Wander through the narrow streets around **Banglamphu** neighborhood to experience old Bangkok.  
### **Shopping, dining and people watching in new areas**
Venture to the modern districts for bustling night markets, glitzy malls and hip neighborhoods. Browse the hundreds of stalls at the weekend's famous **Chatuchak Market**. Later, relax over drinks at **Thong Lo** area's vibrant bars. For high-end shopping under one roof, **Siam Paragon** and **CentralWorld** have every top brand. Don't miss street food finds like in **Khaosan Road** where locals crowd nightly.
## Thai Cuisine and Nightlife
### **Indulging in famous Thai dishes**
No visit is complete without sampling authentic Thai favorites. Must tries are **pad thai** - the iconic stir fried noodles and **tom yum soup**. For a filling meal, opt for **curries** like massaman or green served with jasmine rice. Seafood lovers shouldn't miss **fresh crab fried rice** from street stalls. And you simply must end the night with **mango sticky rice** for dessert. 
### **Experiencing Bangkok's vibrant nightlife**
After dark, head to lively spots where locals unwind. In Silom, **Patpong** buzzes with commercialized shows and shops. Further out, **Thong Lor** and **Ekkamai** streets draw hip crowds looking to sip **craft beers** in relaxed bars. To party late into the night, hit **Khaosan Road** where music blares until dawn. The real adventurous can check out illegal bars in **Nana area** though solo women may feel more comfortable in group.
## Day trips beyond Bangkok
### **Floating through canals to Damnoen Saduak**
Just over an hour southwest lies the idyllic atmosphere of **Damnoen Saduak**. Board a boat to float past villages and see daily rural life up close. Wander baskets laden bridges between the famous floating market stalls selling local snacks, fruits and souvenirs. It's easy to spend a full day enjoying the laidback pace. 
### **Discovering historic ruins in Ayutthaya**
As the former capital, Ayutthaya treasures over 400 temples in various states of decay within its parks. Hire a bicycle to leisurely pedal between landmarks like **Wat Phra Si Sanphet** , once home to enormous standing Buddhas. Wander along **Chao Phraya Riverside** to admire gilded chedis silhouetted against blue skies, comprehending this was once a just as impressive city as Bangkok.
## Final Thoughts
Whether seeking culture, relaxation or thrills, Bangkok overwhelms the senses but ultimately envelops visitors in its charms. By navigating like locals on public transport, eating street eats and checking hidden neighborhoods, one can't help but fall for this hectic but heartwarming city. It may be challenging at first yet rewards with richness of experience. My suggestion is to go with an open mind and you're sure discover why Bangkok continues enchanting millions who keep returning year after year.
