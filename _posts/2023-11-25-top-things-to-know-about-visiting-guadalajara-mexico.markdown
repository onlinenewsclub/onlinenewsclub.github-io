##  Transportation and Accommodation
The most important thing you need to consider when visiting Guadalajara is planning your transportation and accommodation. [Guadalajara transportation systems](https://thetopnews.github.io/bodily-autonomy-respecting-your-partner-s-body-hair-preferences/) and where you will be staying, as the city is very large and spread out. 
When choosing accommodation, opt for a hotel or apartment near the main areas you want to explore. The historic center, Plaza de Armas, Hospicio Cabañas, and Tequila are excellent neighborhoods to stay in. This allows you to easily access attractions on foot while avoiding long commutes. 
Guadalajara also has a developing **public transportation network**. The metro currently has three lines but is expanding. Buses are another affordable option to get around, though traffic can be heavy. Ridesharing apps like Uber are also popular. For areas outside the city center, you may want to rent a car. Advance route planning using maps will help you navigate this sprawling city efficiently.
### Safety Considerations 
While most of Guadalajara is safe to explore during the day, exercise typical safety precautions after dark. As with any large city, avoid walking alone late at night in uncrowded areas. Do not leave valuable belongings unattended. Keep only the cash you need readily accessible and store extra money, cards and documents securely elsewhere like a hotel safe. Using marked taxis or rideshare is preferable over hailing random cabs off the street. Following basic safety guidelines will help ensure you enjoy your Guadalajara experience fully.
