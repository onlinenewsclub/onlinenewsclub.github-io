Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, is one of China's most historic and culturally significant cities. With thousands of years of history etched into its landmarks, there is no shortage of things to do in Xi'an. Here is a guide to 10 of the top attractions and activities in the city. 
###Terracotta Army
No trip to Xi'an is complete without visiting the world famous Terracotta Army. Discovered in 1974, this UNESCO World Heritage Site contains over 8,000 life-sized **terracotta warriors and horses**, buried alongside China's first Emperor Qin Shi Huang over 2,000 years ago. The detailed sculptures provide a glimpse into the craftsmanship and artistic skills during China's Qin Dynasty. Plan at least 2 hours to fully explore this incredible archaeological site. 
###Ancient City Walls
For dramatic city views and a walk back through history, stroll along Xi'an's 14-km **ancient city walls**. Originally constructed in the 14th century, they offer a glimpse into how people fortified their cities over 600 years ago. Make sure to allot at least a half day to fully walk the perimeter while admiring panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. 
###The Big Goose Pagoda
Located within the Forest of Steles Museum complex, the Big Goose Pagoda, or Dayan Pagoda, is Xi'an's most iconic landmark. Originally constructed in the 7th century to house Buddhist sutras and relics brought back from India, it has since been renovated but maintains its distinctive architectural style. It's worth stopping by both for the history as well as panoramic views from the top level observation deck.
###Muslim Quarter
Meander through the vibrant back streets of Xi'an's old Muslim Quarter, where you'll encounter food stalls, shops, fragrant niu rou mian (beef noodles) and lively night markets. This is a great area for losing yourself in local culture and sampling regional snacks like roast chicken, lamb skewers and naan bread. Be sure to stop by the Great Mosque in the heart of the quarter for a glimpse into Islamic architecture. 
###Xian Museum
Housed in Jianfu Temple - one of China's oldest wooden structures - the Xian Museum gives exceptional insights into Shaanxi province's history and artifacts. Its collection includes relics from the Neolithic period through to the Tang Dynasty, with particular focus on life during the Han and Tang eras when Xi'an served as China's **imperial** capital. Plan a minimum of 2 hours to do the museum justice.
###Small Wild Goose Pagoda
Located just 1km south of the Big Goose Pagoda, this Tang Dynasty landmark is notable for its unique architectural style consisting of brick and wooden structures. Views from its top levels overlooking Xi'an, including the larger pagoda, make it worth the climb. Make sure to admire the bas-relief carvings and sculptures depicting Buddhist jataka tales along the stairs as you ascend. 
###Shaanxi History Museum
Featuring breathtaking artifacts from China's oldest civilizations, the Shaanxi History Museum is considered one of China's finest. Galleries trace **11,000 years of history** through bronzes, pottery, paintings, jade objects and tomb models. Highlights include an incredibly preserved 10th century wooden structure and artifacts from the Western Zhou, Han and Tang periods. Allow at least 3 hours to fully soak up its wealth of treasures. 
###Huaqing Hot Springs
For recreational time after sightseeing the sights, visit the Huaqing Hot Springs park located 30km from Xi'an. In addition to scenic hiking trails, it features multiple indoor and outdoor hot spring pools with temperatures ranging from mild to scalding that relax sore muscles. Postcard views from the surrounding mountains and gardens make this an ideal half-day escape into nature.
###Nighttime Fountain Show
Witness a nightly sound, music and light spectacle at the Big Goose Pagoda's fountain square. Over 100 fountains dance to patriotic and traditional Chinese tunes, set against the backdrop of the illuminated pagoda. During peak times up to 10,000 visitors gather for this memorable show. Itâ€™s best viewed in the warmer months due to outdoor settings. 
###Xi'an Tang Dynasty Cultural Show
Held at the Shaanxi Grand Opera House, this spellbinding performance reenacts Tang Dynasty extravaganzas through colorful costumes, dazzling dances and performances by skilled acrobats and musicians. It provides an authentic glimpse into imperial China's most prosperous and culturally rich dynasty. The multi-course banquet dinner served before each show makes it an ideal dinner+show option.
