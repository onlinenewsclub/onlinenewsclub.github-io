## Exploring New Frontiers 
National Geographic Explorers travel to remote and unexplored areas all over the world to conduct groundbreaking research and document biological and cultural discoveries. As an explorer, you will push the boundaries of human knowledge by investigating precious ecosystems, uncovering archaeological sites, and uncovering new species.
### Trekking into the Unknown
Every day, Nat Geo explorers are trekking into inhospitable terrain to make exciting new finds. For example, explorers in Alaska recently discovered an [entirely new cave system](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-12-17-karl-marx-s-unexpected-stay-in-algeria/) stretching for miles underground. By braving frigid temperatures and narrow passageways, these explorers mapped out an extensive network of previously unknown caverns. In the Sahara desert, another team of explorers found evidence of an ancient oasis that was once inhabited, shedding new light on how civilizations formed in such an arid climate. Becoming an explorer yourself means being willing to venture into seldom-visited places and tackle the physical and mental challenges of exploration.

### Documenting Biological and Cultural Discoveries  
National Geographic explorers play a vital role in increasing our understanding of the natural world. Whether studying little-known ecosystems in the rainforest or documenting disappearing indigenous cultures, explorers collect crucial data and **first-hand observations** that expand human knowledge. For example, footage captured by explorers was key to proving the existence of elusive species like the Bhutanese takin goat. Explorers also regularly consult with local communities to document cultural practices respectfully before they fade from memory. Proper documentation skills are a must for any aspiring Nat Geo explorer.
### Sharing Your Journey with the World
A big part of being an explorer is engaging diverse audiences about your discoveries. Explorers share footage, photos and gripping first-person accounts with National Geographic audiences worldwide. Expedition updates keep people fascinated by the explorer's journey in real-time. After returning from the field, explorers synthesize their findings into comprehensive reports and give talks. Presentation skills are important for explorers looking to excite people about exploration and inspire environmental stewardship. Storytelling abilities are highly valued to bring unexplored worlds to life.
