However, this did not cause any harm to their health. **Parle G biscuits** were the best and most affordable food option available under those circumstances.

### Nutritional Value and Calories in Parle G Biscuits 
A single pack of **Parle G biscuits** contains a significant amount of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Specifically, 100 grams of **Parle G biscuits** has around 78 grams of carbohydrates, 12 grams of fat and 6.5 grams of protein. With such a high carbohydrate and calorie content, overeating **Parle G biscuits** on a daily basis can easily lead to weight gain over time. The carbohydrates in **Parle G biscuits** are absorbed and metabolized quickly, causing a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent blood sugar fluctuations stimulate appetite and make it difficult to control calorie intake.
### Risk of Weight Gain from Excessive Biscuit Consumption
Consuming large quantities of **high-calorie biscuits** like Parle G on a daily basis invariably results in weight gain. When more calories are consumed than burned through physical activity and basic metabolic processes, the excess calories get stored as fat in the body. Just 100 grams of **Parle G biscuits**, which is about 6-8 biscuits, provides close to 400 calories. Eating even one or two extra packs per day beyond one's calorie needs can lead to a significant surplus over weeks and months. This sustained calorie overload promotes steady fat accumulation and overweight/obesity. 
### Balancing Biscuit Intake with Physical Activity 
Eating **Parle G biscuits** in moderation as part of a balanced diet does not necessarily cause harm. However, overreliance on calorie-dense biscuits for meals without maintaining an active lifestyle can disturb calorie-nutrient balance. It is important to match daily calorie intake from all food sources with sufficient physical activity for health and weight control. Even consuming **Parle G biscuits** in greater quantities than required may not lead to negative consequences if excess calories are burned through daily exercise and activity. A sedentary routine coupled with excessive biscuit consumption dramatically increases the risk of overweight issues over the long run.
### Portion Control and Whole Food Alternatives 
While an occasional pack of **Parle G biscuits** as a snack is unlikely to be problematic, making them a staple food on a daily basis is not advisable. Biscuits are highly processed and calorie-dense without significant nutrients compared to whole foods. It is better to control portion size of **Parle G biscuits** and combine them with nutritious options like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pulses and dairy as part of balanced meals. Affordable whole foods provide ample nutrition and fiber to feel full for longer, preventing overeating and subsequent weight gain risks associated with a biscuit-heavy diet. 
### Summary 
In moderation as an occasional snack or crisis food when needed, **Parle G biscuits** pose no health risks. However, relying on them as a staple with little variety or physical activity on a daily basis increases chances of weight issues due to excessive calorie intake over time. It is advisable to watch portion sizes of calorie-dense biscuits and opt for wholesome alternatives as the major sources of nutrition as far as possible. Maintaining an active lifestyle and overall calorie-nutrient balance is key to sustaining health, even while including **Parle G biscuits** in the diet.
