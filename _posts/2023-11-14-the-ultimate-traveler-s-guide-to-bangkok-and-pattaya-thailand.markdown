### Getting Your Trip Started Right
One of the most crucial aspects of planning any international trip is managing your money properly. I recommend converting **half your budget into local currency** and keeping the other half in travel cards that can be used internationally if needed. This provides flexibility while minimizing risk. 
Be sure to also **research transportation options** to cut costs. Public transport like the BTS SkyTrain and MRT subway are great ways to get around Bangkok affordably. For travel between cities, buses are a popular cheap option. Having basic maps downloaded will help navigate independently. 
Getting a local SIM with data is also advisable over relying on international roaming which can rack up high bills quickly. Most convenience stores sell SIM cards that provide good coverage nationwide at **affordable prices**. 
You'll find all your basic needs easily available at the ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores as well. Stock up on essential items, snacks and even ready meals here to save money eating out.
### Must-See Attractions in Bangkok
No trip to Bangkok is complete without seeing some of the most iconic attractions like the Grand Palace, Wat Pho temple and famous reclining Buddha statue. Wander around these historical icons to experience Thai culture and architecture at its finest. 
The Chao Phraya River also offers scenic views of the city. Taking a longtail boat ride is a unique way to appreciate Bangkok from the water. Some key sites accessible this way include Wat Arun temple and historic Rattanakosin Island. 
Shopaholics will love exploring the various markets in Bangkok like Chatuchak Weekend Market - one of the largest in the world. Bargain hunting for clothes, accessories, souvenirs and more is half the fun! 
No trip is complete without indulging in the city's famous street food. When in Bangkok, be sure to try **pad thai, som tam salad and mango sticky rice** at the very least. These quintessential Thai dishes are best savored from neighborhood food stalls. 
### Enjoy Pattaya's Beaches and Nightlife
While Bangkok offers historic attractions and culture, Pattaya is renowned as a beach getaway. Spread along the eastern Gulf coast, the city has several beautiful stretches of sand like **Jomtien, Dongtan and Wong Amat beaches**. 
Go for a leisurely stroll, swim in the warm waters or sign up for water activities like jet skiing, banana boat rides and more. Many resorts in Pattaya also have indoor and outdoor pools if you want a swim without going to the beach.
After sunset, the lively nightlife springs to action in Pattaya. Walking Street is the biggest attraction, lined with go-go bars, pubs and restaurants. Also check out Beer Garden and Live Music Pub Street for live performances and drunken revelry. 
Be mindful of scams and **avoid being pressured into anything** like expensive lady drinks. It's better to stick to government-regulated establishments for your own safety. 
### Safety Advice for Travelers
While Thailand is generally safe for visitors, it's always best to exercise caution. Lock valuables in the hotel safe, avoid showing off wealth and be on guard against pickpockets especially in crowded areas. 
Negotiate prices upfront for tour packages, transportation or services instead of paying the initial inflated quotes aimed at foreigners. This ensures you don't overpay. 
Get travel insurance that covers medical evacuation as the healthcare system here works differently than Western countries. Always have emergency contacts accessible too. 
When bar-hopping or visiting adult entertainment areas, **never lower your guard or get in stranger's vehicles**. Be especially careful aroundWalking Street in Pattaya after dark - stick to well-lit main roads if walking back to your hotel alone. 
Use common sense and trust your instincts. With basic precautions, you can enjoy Thailand safely and make the most of your trip to these iconic destinations!
