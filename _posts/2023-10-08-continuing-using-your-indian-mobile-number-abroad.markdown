## Receiving OTPs and keeping your Indian number active while overseas
Maintaining an active Indian mobile number while living abroad can be useful for receiving important verification codes, texts and calls. However, many carriers require regular recharges to keep prepaid SIMs active. Here are some tips and experiences for continuing to use your Indian mobile number overseas.
### Recharging for international roaming 
One option some find helpful is paying for an international roaming package before leaving the country. This allows your Indian mobile number and SIM card to connect to networks abroad. For example, one person shared their experience recharging for a **28-day roaming plan** with Jio for around 1100 INR. This enabled them to continue receiving SMS even after the valid recharge period ended. Paying for roaming just once helped establish the necessary network connections to receive messages internationally ongoing.

### Automatic recharges may still be required
While an initial roaming package facilitates use abroad initially, carriers like Jio may still require occasional minimum recharges to keep your Indian number active longterm. One individual mentioned having to do minimum recharges every 28 days on Jio to maintain service and access [OTP messages from abroad](https://setit.github.io/2024-01-07-menjelajahi-keindahan-danau-malawi/). The small recharge amounts can be for any validity but help comply with the operator's policy to avoid suspending the account. Regular top-ups may thus remain necessary even with international roaming enabled originally. 
### No charges for incoming SMS on some networks 
An alternative discussed was using a mobile provider like Airtel that does not charge for **receiving OTPs and verification SMS** internationally. One person shared their experience of continuing to get codes and messages free of charge on their Airtel Indian number while living in the UK. For those wishing to maintain an active number overseas without regular expenses, carriers without incoming SMS fees can be a better option. Service quality abroad would need researching for different networks however.
## Additional options for international usage 
Maintaining an active Indian mobile number while overseas provides convenience but does require planning and costs. Beyond regular carrier solutions, a few other approaches could work too.
### Using apps for international SMS 
Messaging apps nowadays offer functionality to **receive SMS online without a local SIM**. Services like WhatsApp allow linking an Indian mobile number to continue getting verification codes virtually from abroad. While it may not replace all SMS needs, apps can help bridge the gap for important texts when a local number is not feasible. Data costs would need factoring in however. 
### Porting your Indian number to a local eSIM
An emerging solution seeing more support is **porting an existing Indian mobile number to an eSIM** on a device. This essentially allows retaining the same number but using it via cellular data on international networks. Carriers like Airtel and Jio now facilitate mobile number portability to eSIMs, potentially removing roaming charges. Coverage would depend on the provider's international eSIM partners however.
### Considering a dual SIM phone
For those planning longer international stays, a dual SIM mobile can allow using **a local physical SIM for calls/data alongside retaining the Indian eSIM**. This provides flexibility of a mobile number in each country. Costs are higher initially but may work out cheaper than regular roaming charges longterm. Phone compatibility needs checking for eSIM support too in such cases.
## Conclusion 
In conclusion, maintaining an active Indian mobile number abroad can be achieved through carriers' international roaming packages, minimum regular recharges, or leveraging apps or emerging eSIM technologies. While requiring some expenses, the right solution can ensure continued access to important SMS services from overseas. Researching carrier policies and technologies is important to find the most suitable and affordable approach suited to individual needs and budgets.
