## Exploring Urumqi 
### [Visiting the Grand Bazaar](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-27-un-itin-xe9raire-de-1-semaine-xe0-nassau-aux-bahamas/)
The Grand Bazaar is one of the top tourist attractions in Urumqi. On my visit, I was impressed by the lively atmosphere with people from all walks of life mingling together. Locals and tourists enjoyed dancing together in the courtyard. The food court offered an array of Xinjiang local flavours. Digital payment systems like Alipay were commonly used, demonstrating the region's modernization.

### **Wandering the Streets** 
Wandering the streets near my hotel, I came across a street vendor selling different fruits. He shared that evening was the only time he could sell without getting chased by police. I also noticed a trailer home from Guangxi being towed, showing how travelling by any means is becoming popular in China like other parts of the world. The residential buildings around looked neat and modern.
### **Exploring City Attractions**
I took the clean and modern Urumqi Subway to visit other attractions like the Xinjiang Museum and United States Shopping Mall. The museum provided insights into Xinjiang's rich history and culture along the Silk Road. In the mall, most stores featured global brands and I saw locals going about their daily lives.  
## Learning about Xinjiang's Natural Beauty and Horse Culture
### **Visiting an Ancient Ecological Park and Horse Base** 
I enjoyed touring the park housing precious ancient wood and fossils as well as the neighbouring **Akhal-Teke horse breeding base**. At the horse gallery, a young Uyghur guide passionately shared her knowledge. After, I had a private lunch at the **Horse Wisperer Restaurant** overlooking the scenic park.  
### **A Day Trip to Turpan**
Turpan fascinated me for its extreme heat and unique geography. On my high-speed train ride, I took in scenic desert views. Reaching Turpan, I hired a taxi for a full-day tour, visiting landmarks like the **Flame Mountain** and **Grape Valley**. Lunch with my friendly driver at a local restaurant was a memorable cultural experience.
## Gaining Cultural Insights in Smaller Cities
### **Discovering Yining's Natural Beauty**
In the picturesque city of Yining, I strolled along **Liuxing Street** and explored the **Light of Silk Road Village**. I was impressed by the exquisite architecture and diverse blending of ethnic groups.  
### **Experiencing Uyghur Hospitality in Huocheng County**  
Homestays here gave a glimpse of real Uyghur culture. I particularly enjoyed meeting the talented local artists and sampling lavender products supporting poverty alleviation. The scenic landscapes were truly breathtaking.
### **Learning about Minority Cultures in Xinyuan County**  
I visited Kazakh yurts and attended a traditional wedding ceremony, fascinated by their vibrant traditions. The natural vistas were outstanding, with wild animals roaming freely.
## Appreciating Xinjiang's Rich Performing Arts
### **Enjoying Music in Nalati Park**
In Nalati Park, I came across a local band renowned for throat singing traditional instruments. Their vibrant performance displayed how music thrives in Xinjiang.
### **Witnessing Intangible Cultural Heritage**
On my last stop in Tacheng, I was delighted to learn about the rare Tatar ethnic group's intangible cultural practices, gaining new appreciation for Xinjiang's diversity.
## Final Reflections
My trip across Xinjiang dispelled preconceived notions, instead revealing a region of exquisite natural scenery, thriving commerce and hospitality. Despite its immense size, a sense of harmony prevailed between its ethnicities. I felt privileged to experience the richness of cultural exchanges along the historic Silk Road.
