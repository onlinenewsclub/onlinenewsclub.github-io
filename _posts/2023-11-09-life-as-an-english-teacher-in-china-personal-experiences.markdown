### Starting at a Big Chain School
Teaching at a large franchise school seemed like a safe choice, but issues arose. **Colleagues faced various discrepancies in pay, apartments, and treatment**. The management would [lie and break promises](https://thetopnews.github.io/page14/), changing work conditions without notice. Salaries were unfairly withheld for perceived slights. Friends were misled about pay for bringing in other teachers. Constant fighting was needed to receive proper compensation and rights.

### Navigating Cultural Differences  
Certain expectations in Chinese work culture proved challenging. Top-down changes were assumed to be accepted without question. **Holiday schedules and time off were altered last minute**. The apartments provided were old and unsanitary, plagued by **pests and poor plumbing**. Only one weekday off led to constant exhaustion. However, meeting other expats helped mitigate these difficulties through shared experiences.
### Adjusting to City Life in China
Daily life in the city posed health and comfort issues. Public spitting and urination were common sights. **Summer heat and cold-weather smells pervaded**. **Restaurant hygiene was questionable** - food was thrown about and poor kitchen practices led to many illnesses. With little entertainment, living conditions contributed to separation and depression for some expat couples. Boredom was a constant struggle. 
### Employment at a Language School  
Long weekends teaching children brought behavioral hurdles. **Engaging unenthusiastic language students** required reliance on teaching assistants. Weeks consisted of one-on-one lessons which were preferable. Adults showed warmth, throwing birthday parties and crafting gifts. However, staff endured **taxing teaching hours** from Saturday morning until Sunday evening with minimal breaks.
### Teaching at a Public University
University students offered a rewarding experience. They demonstrated enthusiasm, opinions, and a willingness to discuss diverse topics. **Passing important exams motivated English majors**. Others continued English conversations outside class. Clarifying expectations avoided confrontation with Chinese instructors' conflicting advice. Grades could be overridden, but generally standards were maintained. 
### The Realities of Working at a Private College  
Private college employment amounted to mere formality. **Distracted and disengaged private school students** provided little substance. Faces fixed on phones and tablets dominated classes. Confrontation changed nothing. Without exams or grades at stake, wealthy students faced no consequences for lack of participation or effort. Teaching descended into a demoralizing exercise of filling time rather than fostering learning. Memories of passionate university pupils served as a bitter contrast.
### Facing Harsh Realities and Making a Change
While finding community among other expats helped, work conditions needed addressing. One friend endured a trying negotiation period before resigning on schedule. To avoid similar stress, a salary deduction was accepted to depart early from the exploitative environment. Seeing so many fall into depression and separation highlighted the need for change. With challenges in living standards, workplace respect and real fulfillment missing, it was best to pursue opportunities elsewhere.
