## City of Spicy Foods and Culture 
Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province, is often overlooked by visitors to China in favor of more famous destinations like Beijing and Shanghai. However, for those seeking an authentic Chinese experience off the beaten path, Changsha deserves a spot on your itinerary. As both a longtime resident and native of Changsha, I'm here to share what makes this city so special from an insider's perspective. 
### The Heat of Hunan Cuisine
For those with an appetite for bold flavors, the local cuisine of Changsha is not to be missed. As is characteristic of Hunan province overall, [spicy foods](https://thetopnews.github.io/the-truth-about-getting-a-free-nintendo-switch/) reign supreme in Changsha's kitchens. Dishes are infused with abundant fresh chili peppers which impart a lingering heat that tingles the tastebuds. Even humble ingredients like lettuce are prepared with a fiery kick of Sichuan peppercorns. Rice remains the staple accompaniment, soaking up the savory chili oils used in nearly every meal. Those unaccustomed to such intense spices would be wise to seek out restaurants advertising "mild" options, though true Changsha natives swear nothing beats a meal that earns its name as truly "numbing and spicy."
