### Xi'an and the Terracotta Army
Xi'an was once the capital of several dynasties including the Han and the Tang dynasties, making it a central part of China's long and storied history. One of the most famous attractions is the Terracotta Army, located just outside Xi'an. This life-sized clay army was constructed to honor the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, and contains over 8,000 soldiers, horses and chariots. Walking among the enormous figures is a memorable way to appreciate the skill and effort that went into their creation over 2,000 years ago. Xi'an is also home to the impressive 14th century City Wall, one of the best preserved in all of China. Within the wall lie historic mosques, pagodas and the Shaanxi History Museum with extensive artifacts from ancient dynasties.

### Exploring Tang Dynasty Heritage in Xi’an
Xi’an flourished as the capital city of the [Tang Dynasty](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-ud30c-ud0a4-uc2a4-ud0c4-uc5ec-ud589-uc815-ubcf4/), considered a golden age of Chinese culture and trade routes. The Big Wild Goose Pagoda, originally built in the 7th century to house Buddhist sutras, stands as a landmark of the religious architecture of the time. Nearby is the Daci’en Monastery, one of the largest Buddhist monastic complexes in China. Venturing further afield, the Qianling Mausoleum and Tang Dynasty imperial tombs in the surrounding hills provide glimpses into burial practices of nobility over 1,000 years ago. The Banpo Neolithic Village, located on the outskirts, offers a fascinating step back even further to one of China’s earliest sedentary agricultural communities from around 4500 BC. Xi’an presents visitors with a wide array of cultural treasures spanning millennia.  
### Exploring Ancient Capitals North of Xi'an
A short train ride north of Xi'an lies the small city of Xianyang, once the short-lived capital of the Qin Dynasty which unified China for the first time in 221 BC. Though significantly less touristy than other historic sites, the Xianyang Museum paints a picture of life during this pivotal period through artifacts, models and information panels in Mandarin. Further north is Hua Shan, a dramatic mountain range filled with distinctive pagodas, steep stone paths and breathtaking views perfect for hikers. Climbing the mountain rewards visitors with glimpses into **Daoist and Buddhist rock carvings and shrines** dating back over a millennium. Nearby is Yan'an, where Mao Zedong and the Communist Party established an early base in the 1930s. The Caves of Yan'an give a sense of how revolutionaries lived and worked underground during turbulent times.
### Beijing: Imperial Architecture and Gardens 
Beijing served as national capital for most of imperial China's history and its landmarks tell the story. The Forbidden City, residence of Ming and Qing emperors, is a marvel of Ming architecture with over 900 buildings and 9,999 rooms on 80 hectares. To the north stand the massive structures of Tiananmen Square and Chairman Mao's Mausoleum, emblematic of Communist China. Just south lies **Beihai Park** containing centuries-old pavilions, temples and gardens for ancient scholars and poets. Temple of Heaven park was where emperors performed annual ceremonies to ensure good harvests. Walking along its marble pathways and admiring the intricate Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests recalls an era of divine rule. Outside the second ring road lies the Summer Palace, with its enormous Kunming Lake and Long Corridor providing respite from the bustle of modern Beijing for the Qing imperial court. 
### Suzhou: Classical Chinese Garden Design
A 90-minute train ride from Shanghai brings visitors to the elegant city of Suzhou. Famous for its exquisite gardens, the complex design and integration of nature was inspired by Chinese philosophy emphasizing harmony between humans and the natural world. **The Lingering Garden** with meandering paths winding around ponds, rockeries and pavilions provides a calm oasis amid the city. Nearby is the Humble Administrator's Garden, filled with poetic references to classic literature and meticulous integration of plants, water features and architecture over twelve acres. Scholars' Retreat Garden is smaller yet equally artistic in design. Suzhou shows how Confucian scholars throughout history sought to distill natural beauty from limited land reflecting concepts of restraint. Its gardens allow modern-day tourists a taste of imperial aesthetics prized by past nobility for silent contemplation.
### The Ancient and Modern in Shanghai
Shanghai presents a vibrant mix of Westernized modernity and remaining pockets of Chinese tradition. Venture just outside the city center and step back centuries by visiting classic local villages. Zhujiajiao is one of Shanghai's best preserved water towns, where locals lead lives reminiscent of earlier eras living on boats and along ancient cobbled lanes. Wuzhen further embraces its history as a prosperous Ming trading post by preserving ancient architecture and showcasing river-based industries. Closer to downtown, the Shanghai Museum displays fine artifacts spanning 5,000 years with a focus on Song and Ming period ceramics, calligraphy and painting. Yu Garden offers respite from skyscrapers with its maze of pavilions, narrow lanes and tea houses taking inspiration from Suzhou garden design on a smaller scale. Shanghai balances tradition and progress skillfully for foreign visitors.
### Picturesque Mountain Retreats 
Surrounding Shanghai and further inland rise some of China's sacred mountains offering well-preserved temples, natural scenery and hiking opportunities. Only an hour by fast train from Shanghai is Mount Putuo on an island in the East China Sea, home to over 60 temples and cliffs adorned with 500 arhat statues. Further west near Hangzhou is Mount Jiuhua, considered the number one mountain among China's four sacred Buddhist peaks, with its Golden Summit Temple dating back over 1,000 years. Taiwan's Alishan National Scenic Area is famous for its sunrise views, indigenous villages and moss-covered forests and can be visited easily from Taiwan's larger cities. Those seeking solace in natural beauty close to historic landmarks need look no further than these compelling mountain destinations. 
Visiting China's ancient sites as outlined allows travelers insight into its diverse history in locations crafted for both cultural depth and accessibility. Prioritizing several of these destinations based on personal interests promises a treasured journey of discovery through millennia of art, architecture and philosophical influences that shaped one of the world's greatest civilizations. Learning from the past both informs the present and nourishes the soul in this vast country containing thousands of years of heritage.
