### [Osaka Castle](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-07-u4e07-u90a3-u675c-u7fa4-u5c9b-u6982-u89c8/): A Symbol of Osaka's Rich History 
Osaka Castle is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city. Originally built in the late 16th century by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, it played an important strategic role for controlling western Japan during the Sengoku period. The current structure is a reconstructed castle built in the 20th century, but it still conveys a sense of Osaka's rich military history. Visitors can tour the castle grounds and interior exhibits that showcase artifacts from the Edo period. Don't miss the spectacular view of Osaka from the top floor. Plan to spend at least an hour here to fully appreciate the castle's historical significance.
