Visiting Guadalajara can be an enjoyable experience if you follow some basic safety precautions. As the second largest city in Mexico, it offers a variety of attractions, culture and cuisine worth exploring.
## A Monthlong Stay 
I lived in Guadalajara for a month while **backpacking through Mexico** with my boyfriend. We stayed in an affordable hotel near the city center that was extremely clean despite its reputation. The staff provided excellent customer service. Every day we would spend hours **walking tour of Guadalajara**, fascinated by the city's unique architecture and atmosphere. We visited museums, parks and the iconic Hospicio Caba√±as without any issues.
## A Welcoming Arts Scene  
Guadalajara has a very vibrant arts community. We discovered several **LGBTQ-friendly cultural venues**, like Pride-celebrating bars showcasing local artists. **Vegetarian restaurants** were also plentiful, reflecting the city's progressive values. On weekends, the streets filled with live music, dance and other performances. People seemed friendly and welcoming to outsiders.
## Safety in Numbers
While walking alone as a woman, I did receive unwanted attention from some men. However, it was never aggressive or threatening. Pickpocketing is a risk in crowded areas, but violence against tourists is rare. The biggest problem we faced was petty theft from an unattended vehicle. By exercising normal precautions and avoiding deserted streets at night, visitors have little to fear.
## A Surprisingly Affordable Stay
Our initial hotel provided clean rooms at an excellent value, despite its reputation. We later opted for airbnbs in the hip Colonia Americana neighborhood, **which offered culture and affordability.** This allowed us to extend our trip on a modest backpacker's budget. With careful planning, visitors can experience Guadalajara without breaking the bank.
## Getting off the Beaten Path  
To truly see Guadalajara beyond the tourist spots, we embarked on several day trips. In the charming town of Tlaquepaque, we wandered artistic galleries and workshops. We also visited a tequila distillery to learn about the **agave spirit's production process**. A day trip to the charming mountain village of Tapalpa provided beautiful scenery and insights into rural Mexican culture.
## An Overall Positive Experience
Overall, our month in Guadalajara gave us an enjoyable introduction to Mexican culture. While not without issues like any major city, we found it to be safe and welcoming to foreigners. With basic precautions, visitors have little reason to fear violence. I would recommend spending time in Guadalajara to experience its art, food and pace of life.
