###Getting Prepared for the Cold
Understand temperatures in Chicago in January can kill you if you are outside too long without layers of **winter clothing and protection**. Until 2 years ago, the coldest winter in Chicago was in 1986. With average lows below freezing, it's crucial to dress warmly in **thermal base layers, gloves, hat, and coat**.  
###A Friendly City Despite the Cold
Don't be afraid to talk to people. That’s what I love best about my city. Chicagoans are **friendly, helpful locals**. We enjoy visitors and answering questions about the best ways to stay warm. Locals will happily share recommendations for their favorite warm spots.
###Authentic Deep Dish Pizza 
Don't order a full deep-dish pizza for yourself, especially if you have to fly home and can’t take pizza on the plane. You’ll end up wasting a lot of perfectly good pizza. At **Giordano's pizza** or **Lou Malnati's**, consider ordering just one or two slices instead of a whole pie. Each slice is extremely filling due to the **thick dough, layers of cheese and toppings**. 
###Exploring Indoor Attractions
With winter temperatures, focus your sightseeing on Chicago's many **indoor museums and attractions**. The Art Institute of Chicago houses world-class works spanning centuries. You can spend an entire day wandering the museum without noticing the cold. Other top options include the Field Museum of Natural History, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium. 
###Winter Fun on the Lakefront
Bundle up for a stroll or bike ride along Chicago's **lakefront paths**. On a clear day, you'll enjoy views of the skyline and frozen Lake Michigan. Stop to warm up with **hot cocoa from a cart vendor**. For a scenic photo, brave the elements at one of the iconic lighthouses near Navy Pier. 
###Shopping and Winter Events
Venture into Chicago's bustling downtown for shopping along the **Magnificent Mile**. Many stores remain open late for evening strollers. Check the city's event calendar for any **winter festivals, fairs or concerts** taking place during your visit. These crowd-pleasing events lift locals' spirits during the cold months.
###Hearty Meals for Cold Days
Nothing warms the soul on a frigid Chicago day like a steaming bowl of **chili or homemade soup**. Check restaurant menus and your hotel's dining options for comfort foods like **pot roast, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese**. Top local chains to consider include Portillo's for **Italian beef sandwiches** and hot dogs or Lou Malnati's for take-home deep dish pizza pies.
###Farewell to the Windy City
By July, Chicago's weather transforms, but my last winter in the city remains etched in memory. After braving subzero temperatures, lake effect winds and plenty of layers, I gained new respect for locals who face such conditions year after year. Though I now call another city home, Chicago will always hold a place in my heart.
