### Top Things to Do Around the Convention Center
The Dallas Convention Center is conveniently located near many exciting attractions. Within walking distance, you'll find the West End Historic District and several world-class museums. A top recommendation is the Perot Museum of Nature and Science. This state-of-the-art natural history museum features interactive exhibits on science, nature, and the environment. Another nearby option is Klyde Warren Park, a five-acre urban oasis perfect for relaxing between activities.

### Explore Dallas with the DART Rail System 
For exploring further afield, the [DART light rail system](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-07-u72ec-u81ea-u6e38-u89c8-u632a-u5a01-u65c5-u884c-u5c0f-u8d34-u58eb/) is a great affordable option. Stops near the convention center will take you north, south, east, and west throughout the city. One worthwhile destination is the Mockingbird Station area, home to the Angelika Film Center movie theater and Babes Chicken restaurant. Downtown Carrollton is also accessible, where you can find **vintage shops, boutiques, and family-owned restaurants** like Twisted Root Burger Co. The rail also connects to Trinity Railway Express, providing access to attractions in Fort Worth such as the lively Sundance Square downtown district. 
### Fun Outdoor Activities at White Rock Lake
On the northeast side of the city, White Rock Lake is the largest freshwater lake within Dallas city limits. Spanning over 1,500 acres, this urban oasis features a scenic 3.7 mile trail perfect for walking, jogging, or biking. On pleasant spring days, the lake is a popular spot for **picnics, kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, and other watersports**. You'll see locals and their dogs enjoying the natural surroundings. It's a refreshing escape from the concrete jungle of downtown.
### Explore the Arts District
South of downtown, the Dallas Arts District is home to numerous cultural institutions within walking distance of each other. Must-sees include the Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas Museum of Art, and AT&T Performing Arts Center. The latter is particularly impressive, housing the Winspear Opera House, Wyly Theatre, and Annette Strauss Square for outdoor performances. Wander through the district along Flora Street and witness art and architecture on display. After visiting the museums, cap off your tour with dinner at a nearby restaurant with outdoor patio seating like Boulevardier. 
### Shopping and Nightlife in Uptown and Deep Ellum
No trip to Dallas would be complete without exploring the lively Uptown and Deep Ellum neighborhoods. Uptown is the urban shopping mecca, housing high-end brands, boutiques, and the Domain NORTHSIDE mixed-use development. By night, this area transforms into a social hub dining destinations like GT Fish & Oyster. Just east, funky Deep Ellum attracts a younger crowd with live music venues, street art, and an eclectic array of **locally-owned restaurants and bars serving creative cuisine**. On weekends, the district buzzes with energy well into the night. Whether you want to shop or party, Uptown and Deep Ellum deliver non-stop entertainment options. 
### Tour the George W. Bush Presidential Library & Museum
Located in the northern Dallas suburb of University Park, the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum provides a fascinating look at the life and administration of our 43rd president. The complex maintains exhibits highlighting Bush-era history, artifacts from the White House collection, and an exact replica of the Oval Office. History buffs will appreciate learning about Bush's response to 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Temporary exhibitions also rotate through the main gallery. Besides the educational experience, it's a stirring reminder of the presidency and world events from less than two decades ago.
### Explore More Beyond Dallas Proper
The DART rail connects beyond city limits, providing access to two other notable daytrip destinations. Take the Trinity Rail Express west to Fort Worth, where you can stroll the shops and saloons of charming Sundance Square. Or ride the DCTA line to Denton, a charming college town centered around the University of North Texas. Known for its vintage brick architecture, public art, and live music scene, Denton has accumulated a cult following as a hipster haven just 30 miles north of Dallas. For a taste of Texas beyond the big city, these are worthwhile side excursions.
