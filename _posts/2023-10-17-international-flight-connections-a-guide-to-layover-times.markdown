### Understanding Departure and Arrival Formalities
When connecting between international and domestic flights, it's important to understand the differences in departure and arrival formalities between countries. In most cases, departing an international flight from countries like the United States only requires showing your passport. However, arriving internationally can take much longer. 
Upon arrival in another country, you'll need to go through immigration, customs, possibly recheck your baggage, and security screenings before entering the departure lounge. At major international hubs in the US, the total time from landing to entering the departure lounge can range from 90 minutes to 3 hours. Always assume longer processing times and build a generous buffer into layover connections when arriving internationally.

### Booking Connections with the Same Airline
If both flights are booked on the same ticket with the [same airline or airline alliance partners](https://elviaje.github.io/2024-01-08-un-viaje-revelador-a-tbilisi-georgia/), you have better protection if you miss your connection. The airline is then required to rebook you at no additional cost and provide overnight accommodations if needed. This is preferable to separate bookings with different carriers who have no obligation to help.
When connecting internationally, many travelers prioritize booking with one airline for reassurance. However, tight layovers still carry risks of delays missing the second flight. If possible, it's best to avoid layovers under 2 hours, especially for the last flight of the day.
### Exceptions to the 1-Hour Rule 
While a 1-hour layover seems dangerously short, there are rare cases where it can work under the right conditions. Airports like Dublin and Reykjavik have efficient processes allowing 50-45 minute connections on occasion. However, this assumes:
- No need to switch terminals which adds substantial travel time
- No checked bags to reclaim slowing down immigration  
- Arriving flight is not delayed pushing back the timeline
- Departing gate is still open upon arrival 
Unless all factors perfectly align, count on longer minimums. Most experts recommend at least 2 hours to feel comfortable on international connections.
### Calling the Airline for Layover Advice
When considering tight layovers, the best source of information is directly from the airline operating the route. Representatives can advise on recommended minimum times based on that specific airport/terminal setup. They may also have insights on typical on-time performance and factors like inter-terminal transportation schedules. 
Calling provides clarity on real-world feasibility versus just published times. Representatives can also indicate flexibility if a delay occurs. International connections are high risk for missing flights, so airlines typically do what they can to reaccommodate stranded passengers when possible.
### Delay Contingency is Critical  
No matter how short the scheduled layover, international air travel delays are common due to factors like congestion, weather and unanticipated issues. Between 2010-2019, over 20% of US flights experienced delays according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Building a delay buffer into connections is important risk management. 
Arriving at the connecting airport the night before or early that morning avoids cutting it too fine. Missing an international flight can result in significant hassles and costs for alternative transportation. Prioritizing arrival time over the absolute shortest layover brings much needed scheduling flexibility.
### Weighing Cost Savings Against Connection Risk
While tempting to save money on rock-bottom fares with very short layovers, the risks often outweigh potential savings if something goes wrong. Missing a connection means dealing with finding a new flight, unexpected overnight costs and travel disruption. The cost of rebooking last minute international tickets often negates any initial booking savings. 
Travelers need to consider their own tolerance for tight schedules and delays before choosing connecting flights. For most, it’s preferable to pay a somewhat higher fare for a routing with layovers 2 hours or longer providing a buffer for schedule changes outside one’s control. Peace of mind has value, and stress-free travel is worth paying a premium for in many situations.
### Summary
When booking international flight connections, longer layovers of 2 hours or more are generally recommended to feel comfortable making the connection on time. Exceptions can occur, but many factors need perfect alignment. Calling the airline provides real insight on feasibility beyond published times. Planning contingency by arriving early avoids risk of missing flights from delays outside of one’s control. Weighing schedule flexibility against potential cost savings is important for stress-free travel. Booking with the same carrier provides reassurance during tight connections.
