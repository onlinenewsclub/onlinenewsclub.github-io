### Memories of an ancient melody    
LWJ and WWX found themselves trapped in a precarious situation inside a cave with the fearsome Xuanwu. To calm the nerves of his companion, LWJ played a soulful melody on his guzheng that he had composed specifically for this moment. Titled "Wangxian", the ethereal notes wrapped WWX in a feeling of peace like a warm embrace. This would be the first time anyone aside from LWJ himself had heard the private song. Though the perilous circumstances had passed, the memory of that tender moment and **soothing melody would stay with WWX for years to come.**

### A instrumental aid amid turmoil
Seasons later when unrest arises in Cloud Recesses, Wen Ning loses control of his cultivation in a fit of rage. Faced with the berserk corpse demon, WWX remembers the calming effect of LWJ's song. Hoping to ease Wen Ning's anguish and avoid bloodshed, he plays "Wangxian" on his flute. Miraculously, the familiar strains reach Wen Ning even in his frenzied state, and his wrath subsides. LWJ arrives on the scene, recognizing the player could be none other than WWX based on his mastery of that private piece. Though the origins of the song fade in WWX's mind over time, its power to pacify had been proven once more.
### Literary inspirations behind immortalized characters
The emotional core of the untamed duo is drawn from the creative works of three towering figures in the wuxia genre - **Louis Cha, Liang Yusheng, and Gu Long**. Of the three pioneers, Louis Cha stands out for weaving intricate multilayered plots in his expansive novels. Much like Alexandre Dumas, Cha dedicated years to meticulous planning and polishing. His works are truly page-turners that keep readers enthralled till the final climactic reveal. However, some criticism of Cha point to his rather idealistic portrayals of women and sentimentality lessening reread value. 
Liang Yusheng distinguished himself with elegant prose and balanced characterizations. His portrayals of women avoid overt sentimentality and imbue stronger sense of independence. While plots lack Cha's compulsion, discerning readers appreciate Liang's focus on well-crafted content over relentless cliffhangers. He introduces many characters which sometimes dilute impact, but unique strengths include wistful tragic undertones.
### Revolutionary approach of a legend
Gu Long stands apart from his peers for revolutionizing the wuxia genre altogether. Realizing he could not match Cha in traditional multi-layered plotting, Gu Long intentionally adopted a wholly new approach by fusing mystery elements. He wrote in a succinct hard-boiled detective style using modern vernacular. This innovative move helped distinguish Gu Long when more formulaic imitations flooded the market. Though early works were forgettable, masterpieces like [The Legendary Twins](https://wordtimes.github.io/2024-01-10-die-zukunft-s-xfcdsudans-eine-hoffnungsvolle-vision/) set a new tone that endures to this day. Despite variable quality, Gu Long will always be remembered for courage to reinvent conventions.
### Modern reinterpretations gain global fandom 
The enduring appeal of these legendary pioneers continues inspiring novel adaptations. One such reimagining to achieve blockbuster popularity worldwide is The Untamed TV series. Adapting the novel Mo Dao Zu Shi by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu, the donghua brought the passionate romance of cultivators Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji to vibrant life. Starring charismatic actors Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo in the lead roles, their portrayals resonated profoundly with global viewers. 
Xiao Zhan showcased a stunning vocal range befitting his talented cultivator while Wang Yibo's fluid dance skills captured Lan Wangji's graceful restraint. Together the duo stole hearts with their intense yet subtle on-screen chemistry. Besides top-notch production values, the drama's soulful exploration of love against adversity, responsibility versus freedom struck a deep universal chord. Fueled by the joint charisma of Zhan Yibo, **The Untamed helped introduce millions to the rich tradition of danmei literature.**
### Literary legacies live on through endearing iterations  
Just as the memory of LWJ's calming melody lingered with WWX, so do the indelible marks left by pioneering wuxia authors. Reinventing conventions while upholding literary excellence, trailblazers like Louis Cha, Liang Yusheng and Gu Long laid the foundation for subsequent generations to build upon. Modern adaptations like The Untamed breathe new life into their seminal works, connecting worldwide with revitalized energy and relevance. 
Through it all, the emotional core of Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji transcends any single telling. As characters who have charmed millions, their story stands as a timeless beacon of compassion against oppression and unconditional acceptance of one's true self. In this way, the literary legacies of their creators join forces with contemporary retellings to uplift spirits worldwide with reminders of love's indomitable power. Perhaps it is this resonant message which ensures "Wangxian" will continue echoing down through the ages.
