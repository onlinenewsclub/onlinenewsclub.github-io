### Infrastructure and Development
Dubai has built an impressive infrastructure over the past few decades and is considered the most developed city in the Middle East in terms of infrastructure and facilities. The city boasts world-class airports, metro systems, roads, shopping malls and hotels. **However, Doha is rapidly catching up as it prepares to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022.** Massive infrastructure projects like expanding the metro network, building new roads, transportation hubs and stadiums are transforming Doha. While **Dubai still has an edge due to its head start, the infrastructure gap between the two Gulf cities is narrowing each year.**

### Culture and Heritage
While **both Dubai and Doha offer modern amenities and attraction, Doha has a stronger sense of local Arabian culture and heritage.** Historical sites like the Museum of Islamic Art, Souq Waqif - a traditional market and Villaggio Mall which is styled like an Arabic village immerse visitors in Qatari traditions. On the other hand, many feel that rapid modernization has compromised Dubai's cultural authenticity. Doha's urban planning also ensures old and new structures co-exist, preserving the city's unique identity. 
### Cosmopolitan Vibes
Both Gulf capitals attract migrants from around the world giving them a **cosmopolitan flair. However, Doha has maintained a more balanced cultural mix** with sizable expatriate communities from Asia, Middle East and Europe living harmoniously alongside locals. **Dubai, on the other hand, is sometimes criticized for losing touch with its Arab roots amid skyscrapers.** Doha offers a smoother cultural transition for visitors used to a moderate lifestyle.
### Things to See and Do 
While **malls and beaches are Dubai's main attractions, Doha is making efforts to develop unique landmarks and activities.** Entering its infrastructure boom ahead of 2022, exciting projects like Qetaifan Island North, Al Khor Coastal Road and Lusail City are adding varied attractions. Doha's scenic coastal Corniche promenade, Katara cultural village and Sealine Beach are favorites with families. Major events like Doha Jewellery & Watches Exhibition and Qatar Masters golf tournament keep the calendar busy.
### Cost of Living 
The cost of living in **Dubai may seem less steep primarily due to its developed real estate and retail markets.** However, groceries and utilities in pollution-free Doha work out comparable or slightly cheaper due to government subsidies. Healthcare, too, is more affordable in gas-rich Qatar. **Rents in central areas are on par in both cities.** While salaries appear higher in Dubai, taxes take a bigger share there balancing living costs in the long run. 
### Environment and Sustainability  
With its green building code and tree-lined streets, **Doha presents a greener cityscape compared to the concrete jungle that Dubai is often portrayed as.** Qatar's compact size allows it to focus on environmentally-friendly urban planning unlike the more sprawling development of its neighbor. From ditching plastic bags to investing in solar and clean energy, Doha is committed to sustainability for a liveable future.
In conclusion, both Dubai and Doha offer modern Gulf lifestyle but discerning expats and travelers are recognizing **Doha's emerging advantages in culture, community feel, environmental measures and infrastructure.** Its rapid upgrades will make the Qatari capital an even more complete destination in the coming decade. While Dubai will likely retain its status as the flashy face of the region for some time, those wanting to experience the essence of Gulf Arab culture may find **Doha a refreshing change as its star ascends.**
