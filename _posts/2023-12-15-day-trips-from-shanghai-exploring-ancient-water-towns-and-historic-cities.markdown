Aside from exploring the modern metropolis of Shanghai, history and culture lovers can find plenty to admire on popular day trips to nearby Hangzhou, Suzhou, and water towns closer to the city. Scroll down for highlights from these fascinating destinations.
### Waterway Wonders of Tongli
Tongli is easily reached in under two hours by train or tour bus from Shanghai. Often compared to Venice for its intricate network of canals, Tongli has maintained its waterbound charm despite modern development surrounding it. Winding through the town are dozens of stone **bridges hundreds of years old,** with the oldest believed to date back over 600 years. Stroll across these bridges passing traditional architectural styles, craft shops, and bustling market streets all connected by the flowing waters. A must is sampling the town's renowned [pork noodle soup](https://northtimes.github.io/2024-01-08-u30ac-u30fc-u30ca-u65c5-u884c-u306e-u8a71/) cooked fresh on boats in the canals.

### Historical Hangzhou West Lake District
As China's most renowned beauty spot thanks to its poetic descriptions by ancient poets, Hangzhou's famed West Lake area repays visitors with gorgeous natural scenery and cultural heritage. Spend a day exploring lakeside promenades, pagodas, and **temples showcasing over a thousand years of Buddhist art and architecture.** Marvel at buildings like the 28-meter tall Leifeng Pagoda built in 699 AD. Wander lush gardens and parks dotted with century-old trees and pavilions before enjoying local Hangzhou specialties like Dragon Well tea. Under two hours by express train, its history and natural charms make it an enriching complement to the crowds and pace of Shanghai city life. 
### Artistic Suzhou's Classical Gardens 
Renowned for its exquisite gardens, the city of Suzhou lies a short train ride from Shanghai and boasts over 60 classical private gardens showcasing centuries of landscape design techniques and styles. Top sights include the large Humble Administrator's Garden filled with artful rock formations and plaques of ancient calligraphy, and the small Lingering Garden praised for its harmonious blend of natural elements. Spend relaxing hours strolling intricate pathways, ponds and pavilions taking in changing perspectives, details, seasonal flowers, and tranquility away from the outside world. After exploring the intricately designed gardens, wander the UNESCO heritage listed Shizi Street's traditional alleyways and architecture. 
### Discover Ancient Water Towns of Qingpu
For a taste of inland China's rich water town heritage right on Shanghai's outskirts, the northeastern Qingpu district holds charming historic towns dating back 900 years. Tongli, described above is a highlight, but other lovely options within an hour include Zhujiajiao with ancient stone bridges and alleys, or Xitang's cobbled streets and dwellings. Wander at a leisurely pace absorbing village life carried out much as it has for centuries. Spot exquisite woodwork designs, quaint shopfronts and elderly locals playing chess by the waterside while tasting local specialties like freshwater fish and lotus seed snacks. These intimate, historic towns offer a welcome change of pace and perspective from the bustle of Shanghai.
### Buddhist Art and Natural Beauty of Mount Putuo
A bit farther afield but worth overnighting on for spiritual and visual enjoyment is the pilgrimage island of Mount Putuo located off Zhoushan Archipelago. Reached by passenger ferry, the mountain is revered as the bodhimanda (sacred land) of Guanyin, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy. Its serene landscape dotted with over 60 Buddhist temples showcases exquisite carvings, domes and colored glazed tiles in designs evolving from Ming to Qing dynasties. Hike forested trails to sea cliff panoramas and waterfalls taking in the spiritual calm. Stay at the UNESCO heritage listed Puzhao Temple complex, one of China's largest, to fully experience the religious ambience. Transportation from Shanghai takes around 3 hours each way.
### Appreciating Ancient Canals of Suzhou
Beyond its famous gardens, the charm of Suzhou lies in exploring its ancient waterway heritage. Wandering Suzhou's crisscrossing canals reveals vistas of graceful bridges and centuries-old dwellings concealed down tranquil alleys. Hop on a classic **wooden pagoda boat** navigated by local boatmen to glimpse daily life along the water from a slow cruise perspective. Wander **Shizi Street's** historic architecture lined with embroidered silk and local snacks plus quaint boutiques. Relax in one of many exquisite classical gardens opening directly onto the canals like Canglang Ting, or admire nighttime scenery from a restaurant cruiser. Allow a full day to fully soak up Suzhou's nostalgic charms away from the crowds.
### Conclusion
From relaxing gardens and centuries of art to quaint historic towns and natural splendors, these popular day trips offer welcome escapes just outside of booming Shanghai. With efficient public transportation and rich heritage waiting to be explored, history and culture enthusiasts will find each trip highly worthwhile and enlightening.
