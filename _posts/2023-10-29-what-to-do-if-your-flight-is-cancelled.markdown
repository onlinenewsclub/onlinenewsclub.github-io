Airline and airport travel experiences depend on many factors outside your direct control. An unexpected flight cancellation can disrupt even the best-laid travel plans. Here are some tips to help you cope and minimize issues should your flight be cancelled.
### Rebooking Options 
If your flight is cancelled, the first step is to check with [airline customer service](https://thetopnews.github.io/do-employees-at-abc-have-email-addresses-using-the-abc-com-domain/) about rebooking options. Most airlines will try to rebook you on their next available flight. However, seats fill up fast, so don't delay contacting the airline for new travel arrangements. Your airline ticket may provide rebooking flexibility to another date within a certain number of days of your original travel dates. Make sure to understand any change fees, fare differences, or other costs that may apply to new bookings.

### Flight Vouchers or Cash Refunds
Some airlines only offer travel **vouchers valid for future bookings** instead of cash refunds for cancelled flights. Be sure to understand the voucher terms, such as expiration dates. If a cash refund is important to you, confirm the airline's refund policy and explore your options under applicable consumer protection regulations. 
### Hotel and Ground Transportation
A flight cancellation can disrupt your hotel reservations or plans for ground transportation, especially if you have connecting domestic or international flights. **Notify any hotels or rental car agencies** of your changes as soon as possible to avoid no-show fees or difficulties with reservations. Consider adjusting stays or pickup/return dates and locations based on your rebooked flights.
### Travel Insurance Claims 
If your flight is significantly delayed or cancelled, you may be eligible for expense reimbursement or compensation through your travel insurance plan. **Review your policy details** on coverage for cancellations, delays, additional expenses, or lost bags in these scenarios. Keep documentation of your claim to submit to your travel insurance provider along with receipts for related costs like new flights, hotels, meals, or transportation.
### Contact Travel Agents or Tour Operators 
For package vacations involving flights and guided tours or activities, notify your travel agent, tour operator or cruise line right away about cancellations. These companies face their own challenges in rebooking transportation and accommodations for groups. They also have experience handling disruptions and may be able to assist or advise on options better than dealing with each separate airline or supplier yourself.
### Traveler Protection Regulations  
Domestically, rules under the US **DOT prohibits denying passengers confirmed reserved space** or charging extra fees if a flight is cancelled due to factors within the airline's control. The DOT may investigate excessive delays or chronic problems. For international flights, look to protections under your specific country or the Montreal Convention for recourse over significant travel hardships beyond your control.
### Plan For Potential Delays
No matter how a flight cancellation is handled, the revised travel itinerary could still face delays. **Pack extra medications, baby supplies, change of clothes and comfortable walking shoes** to better handle potential airport layovers and setbacks. Consider travel delays part of the experience and bring entertainment like books, mobile games or laptops loaded with movies. With preparation and flexibility, you can better roll with potential travel disruptions.
