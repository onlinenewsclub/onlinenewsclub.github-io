## Factors to Consider when Choosing an Airline 
There are several important factors to consider when selecting an airline for direct international flights from India to major cities in the United States such as **Chicago, San Francisco**, and [New York](https://notiziedioggi.github.io/about/). Some key criteria include direct flight availability, travel preferences on layovers, baggage allowance, flight schedules, onboard amenities, and loyalty programs.  
### Airline Selection
When originally traveling to the US for leisure purposes, I enjoyed adding a brief European stopover on my journey so I could experience a new country. Carriers like **Lufthansa** and **Swiss International Air Lines** often had appealing route and price combinations allowing such layovers. However, in recent years I've favored flying direct on airlines with strong Indian culinary options and crew like **Etihad** and **Emirates**.

### Inflight Experience 
**Emirates** consistently delivers an excellent **economy class** experience. Their seats provide generous legroom while the extensive entertainment library and tasty meals make long flights highly enjoyable. Spacious lounges in **Dubai International Airport** and the iconic **Airbus A380** further enhance the Emirates brand.
### Domestic Timings 
**Air India's** nonstop routes from India to major US cities like **Chicago, San Francisco, and New York** depart late night and arrive early morning local time. This schedule syncs well with connecting domestic itineraries within the US.
## Air India: The Best Choice for Direct India to US Flights
### Generous Baggage Allowance
Air India permits 46kg of checked baggage, significantly more than most competitors. This helps Indian families and business travelers carrying extra luggage. 
### Friendly and Familiar Crew 
Flight attendants on Air India routes to North America reflect India's diversity and many are proficient in languages like **Punjabi, Marathi**, and others alongside English and Hindi. The familiar culture creates a welcoming atmosphere.
### Spacious Cabins and Amenities
Air India utilizes wide-body aircraft like the Boeing 777 on key routes equipped with ample legroom and rich inflight entertainment selection of Hollywood, Bollywood, and local media.
### Network and Alliance Benefits
Flying Returns allows accrual of miles on Air India's wide network. As a Star Alliance member, miles can also be earned and redeemed on partner airlines worldwide. Lounge access is provided at airports across the alliance network. 
### On-time Performance
Stringent schedules keep flights punctual for smooth transfers. Air India's dominance prompted American Airlines to cease competing Delhi-Chicago service due to consistent on-time performance.
## Loyalty with Flying Returns
As a top tier loyalty program, Flying Returns enables accumulation of reward miles simply by flying Air India and Star Alliance carriers. Various spending and redemption options expand the value of accrued miles, whether purchasing tickets or upgrading cabins. The program actively engages loyal passengers through promotions, newsletters, and priority benefits.
## Ground Travel Conveniences  
With major destinations connected nonstop like Delhi-San Francisco, Mumbai-New York, and Hyderabad-Chicago, tedious connections are avoided. Additionally, pre-clearance procedures at airports in India smooth US entry. Memberships in Skyteams like Plaza Premium Lounge provide relaxation areas before boarding.
## Personal Recommendation
Considering direct flights, amenities, culture, and loyalty benefits, Air India stands out as the top choice for traveling between India and major US cities. The alluring combination of space, service quality, and convenience makes Air India my top recommendation.
