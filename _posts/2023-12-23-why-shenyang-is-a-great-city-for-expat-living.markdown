Shenyang is the capital and largest city of Liaoning Province in northeastern China. As an expat who lived in Shenyang from 2010 to 2011, I found the city to have many advantages for foreign residents. In this article, I will share my experience living in Shenyang and explain why it remains a fantastic place for expats to call home.
### Affordable Housing near the City Center
When I lived in Shenyang, housing costs were very reasonable compared to other cities in China. I rented a large two-bedroom apartment right across from Taiyuan Street, the main shopping area, for just 2,500 RMB per month. Even today, you can still find spacious 100+ square meter apartments within central neighborhoods for around 2,000 RMB monthly. For ex-pats seeking affordable yet conveniently located housing, Shenyang definitely delivers.

### Authentic and Delicious [Dongbei Cuisine](https://thelivenews.github.io/2024-01-04-the-geographic-origins-and-cultural-influences-of-indonesia/)  
The food in Shenyang and surrounding Liaoning province is simply spectacular. Known as **Dongbei cuisine**, the regional dishes have a distinctive flavor profile unlike other Chinese cooking styles. While I can't pinpoint exactly what I love most about these dishes, I rarely left a Dongbei restaurant unsatisfied. As a self-professed Dongbei foodie, living in Shenyang gave me easy access to top-notch versions of classics like suancai fish, zhajiang noodles, and laozichicken. 
### Diverse Culture with Korean Influences
The culture in northeast China has a unique character all its own. With **Korean cultural influences** prominently on display, the local dialect, customs, and even architecture took on a noticeably different feel compared to other parts of China. I enjoyed interacting with Chaoxian ethnic minority communities and sampling Korean restaurants not found elsewhere in the country. Northeasterners also seemed to know how to party harder after work than residents from other regions!
### Different International Community 
Unlike major expat hubs with predominantly American or English-speaking communities, Shenyang attracts a more diverse mix of foreigners. Many expats hail from Korea, Germany, France and other European nations due to joint manufacturing ventures in Liaoning. As an American, I appreciated this less homogeneous environment and valued meeting expats from new cultures. The international community offered a refreshing change of pace.
### Convenient Northern China Gateway
Located in China's northeast, Shenyang has superb transportation links to other regions. High-speed rail makes reaching destinations like **Harbin, Beijing, Tianjin** and coastal Shandong Province a breeze. I fondly remember weekend trips to spectacular Changbaishan Mountain on the China-North Korea border or day excursions exploring Ji'an's ancient city walls. Shenyang's centralized location provides an ideal jumping off point for exploring northern China.
### Relaxing Environment for Daily Life  
In recent years, Liaoning's economy has weakened but Shenyang continues developing as the northeast's dominant city. Public security improves annually as the government prioritizes developing Shenyang into a "civilized city". As such, expat daily life feels peaceful and hassle-free. While growth has slowed, living costs maintain their affordability while urban infrastructure and amenities steadily advance.
### History and Culture Abound
For those interested in Chinese history and culture, Shenyang offers access to heritage sites aplenty. Notable attractions include the elegant **Former Residence of Prince Gong** gardens and the **Shenyang Imperial Palace Ruins** displaying Qing Dynasty architectural splendor. Further afield, the **Fengtian Men Relics Park** outside of town preserves a set of Ming city walls stretching over ten kilometers in each direction. History buffs will stay thoroughly engaged exploring the city's imperial past.
### Green Spaces for Exercise and Relaxation 
In addition to cultural sights, Shenyang features lovely parks perfect for recreation and exercise. Chief among them, expansive **Beiling Park** occupies a tidy area once belonging to an imperial tomb complex. Shaded pathways wind through gardens, pavilions and ancient temples great for walks, jogging or outdoor activities. Bird Island along the Hun River is another top spot for **scenic cycling** and weekend picnics with friends and family.
In conclusion, with its affordable cost of living, tasty cuisine, diverse culture and convenient location, Shenyang makes an outstanding choice for expat relocation. As a former resident, I remain very fond of this underrated Chinese city and believe it offers the complete package as a livable, history-rich metropolis. While economic conditions evolve, Shenyang will always retain its distinct Northeastern charm appealing to global residents.
