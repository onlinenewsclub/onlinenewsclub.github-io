### Ideal for Entrepreneurship and Business Growth
Chongqing government was among the first local governments to encourage entrepreneurship in China. They refer to small start-ups as "微企". There are many beneficial policies for "微企" companies, including tax exemptions, reductions and access to cheap or free office spaces, along with direct financial incentives of around $20,000 USD for each start-up. **These supportive start-up policies** have helped foster a thriving entrepreneurial environment in Chongqing.
In addition to start-up policies, Chongqing has also developed strategic transportation infrastructure that provides [profitable conditions](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-10-visiter-l-xc9rythr-xe9e-un-pays-aux-richesses-culturelles-et-historiques-m-xe9connues/) for local industries to flourish. As one of the largest inland harbors in China, Chongqing serves as a major transportation hub with highways, railways and the new "渝新欧" railway project connecting China to Central Europe - the "new silk road". Industries like automobiles and electronics have grown significantly in Chongqing due to the strategic location and transportation access.
