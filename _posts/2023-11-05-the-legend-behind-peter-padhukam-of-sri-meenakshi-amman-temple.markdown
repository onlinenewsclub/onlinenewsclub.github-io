### The British Collector Who Earned the Nickname "Peter Pandian"
Collector Rous Peter was first appointed as the Collector of Madurai in 1812 and held the position till 1828. Though a Christian by faith, he respected all religions including Hinduism and honored local traditions. As the temple administrator of the Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple, he conducted his duties sincerely without any prejudice. He treated people of all faiths equally, which earned him the popular nickname "Peter Pandian". 
Everyday on his way to office, he would cross the [Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-08-vivre-xe0-riyad-en-tant-qu-expatri-xe9e-une-opportunit-xe9-enrichissante/). As a mark of respect, he would get down from his horse, remove his hat and shoes, and walk barefoot along the temple path. This small gesture showed his deep reverence for the Goddess.

### A Divine Intervention Saves the Collector's Life
One rainy night, Collector Peter was abruptly woken up by the sound of anklets. To his surprise, he saw a little girl dressed in fine silk attire and ornaments calling out to him "Peter, come this way". He followed her out of the house only to witness his bungalow being washed away by the **flood waters of the Vaigai River**. As suddenly as she appeared, the girl vanished. Realizing it was no ordinary child but the Goddess herself who had saved his life, he was filled with gratitude.
### A Precious Gift of Golden Padhukams 
To express his gratitude, Collector Peter wanted to offer the Goddess a gift. After consulting the temple priests, he commissioned a unique pair of golden footwear studded with **412 rubies, 72 emeralds and 80 diamonds**. Known as the "Peter Padhukams", they are ornamented on the Goddess' feet during the annual Chitrai Festival. His name "Peter" was also engraved on the sole of the footwear. To this day, the exquisite pair of Padhukams remain one of the most prized possessions of the temple.
### The Collector's Last Wish
In recognition of the Goddess’ blessing, Collector Peter wished that after his death, he should be buried facing the temple. Remarkably, his grave in the Christian burial ground is aligned such that his eyes are set towards the **Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple**, unlike other graves which face the opposite direction - a testament to his unshakable faith. 
Even after his passing two centuries ago, the story of Collector Peter or "Peter Pandian" continues to inspire many with his spirit of communal harmony and religious tolerance. The beautiful **Peter Padhukams** enduringly stand as a symbol of his eternal devotion and gratitude towards the divine Mother, **Sri Meenakshi Amman**.
### An Annual Pilgrimage by the Collector's Descendants
To this day, **descendants of the Rous Peter family** from England make an annual pilgrimage to the Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple to pay their respects. During their visit, they also seek the Goddess’ blessings at the **Peter Padhukams** which their ancestor had gifted. 
Preserving family traditions across generations and borders, this act of pilgrimage is a testament to the unbroken bond between the British collector and the revered Goddess, rooted since over 200 years ago.
### Why Restrictions Exist at the Underground Varahi Temple 
The underground Varahi Temple in Varanasi dates back to between the 11th-12th century CE. Some theories suggest it was built underground to safeguard the deity from invaders during periods of strife. Another view is that it honors Goddess Varahi's association with the earth and nether realms.
Restrictions on **direct darshan** (viewing) exist for safety and preservation purposes. As an underground structure, strict protocols are necessary. Like certain temples only allowing access on special occasions or certain groups, limitations here could also stem from traditional practices. 
While direct darshan may not be permitted, arrangements are made so devotees can still catch a **glimpse of the deity's feet or replica idols**. This ensures protocols are respected while also fulfilling spiritual needs. Every temple has its own practices and restricting complete access shows prudence rather than aversion.
### Lessons in Tolerance, Gratitude and Faith 
The legend of Collector Peter offers many lessons. His attitude of religious tolerance in administering the temple set an exemplary standard. Risking his life to save orphaned children, he personified compassion. 
His unshakeable faith was evident even in death by orienting his final resting place towards the temple. Most remarkably, the annual pilgrimage by descendants displays how bonds of gratitude can transcend generations. 
The restrictions at Varahi Temple underscore that spiritual needs can be fulfilled through reverence and protocols, without compromising beliefs. Ultimately, the stories reaffirm eternal virtues of tolerance, gratitude and unflinching faith that connect souls across time.
