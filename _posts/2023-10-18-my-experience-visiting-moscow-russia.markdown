### Moscow is Huge in Every Way
One of the first things I noticed during my visit to Moscow was just how [massive everything seemed to be](https://codeces.github.io/2024-01-09-meksika-gezilerindeki-deneyimlerim/). The streets, squares, buildings - they were all on a monumental scale that really took me by surprise. Having visited many major European cities before like London, Paris and Rome, Moscow dwarfed them all in terms of sheer size. Distances between attractions could be quite far to cover on foot, requiring efficient public transport to get around. 
I initially found the scale of things in Moscow a little overwhelming and disorientating. It took some time to get used to the expansive layout of the city and adjusted my sense of proportion. However, once I got accustomed to Moscow's enormity, I could really appreciate the grand architecture and impressive skyline it created.

### Witnessing the Divide Between Wealth and Poverty
Another aspect of Moscow that struck me was the distinct **class divisions visible on the city streets**. It was quite noticeable how polarized things were, with luxury vehicles rubbing shoulders with old run-down cars. The gap between the haves and have-nots seemed very pronounced. 
This dichotomy was highlighted further by the contrasting architectural styles. Opulent historical buildings would be located near shabbier Soviet-era structures. Such visible disparities in wealth were an interesting facet of daily life in Moscow that I had not really expected to such a degree. It painted a vivid picture of the inequality present in modern Russian society.
### Navigating Moscow's World-Class Metro System
To effectively get around the huge expanses of Moscow, I relied heavily on the city's excellent metro rail network. The **Moscow Metro** system is rightfully renowned as one of the busiest, most efficient metro networks globally. 
Stations were works of art in themselves, decorated with magnificent mosaics, sculptures and architectural flourishes. It was fascinating to admire the ornate interiors between stops. With trains arriving every couple of minutes, the metro was also incredibly punctual and reliable for transportation. 
While signs and maps were mostly in Cyrillic, key stations also had their names displayed in English or transcribed to the Latin alphabet. This helped lost souls like myself to navigate without difficulty. The metro undoubtedly made exploring Moscow an enjoyable and stress-free experience.
### Cultural Wonders of the Kremlin and Red Square
No trip to Moscow would be complete without a visit to the iconic landmarks of Red Square and the Kremlin. This was arguably the **highpoint of my entire Russian holiday**.
Stepping into Red Square for the first time, the sheer grandeur and historical significance of the location took my breath away. Being able to admire St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin's exquisite palaces up close was simply awe-inspiring. The colorful tents in the Square added constant visual entertainment as well.
Wandering through the Kremlin grounds further reinforced the political and religious importance Moscow held as the capital of Russia. The opulent interiors of the grandiose cathedrals contained breathtaking religious artwork spanning centuries. This area left me with unforgettable memories of Russian heritage, culture and artistic brilliance.
### Embarking on a Trip to St. Petersburg
Having thoroughly enjoyed exploring Moscow over a few days, I decided to take a high-speed train to visit another iconic Russian city – St. Petersburg. Known as the ‘Venice of the North’, St. Petersburg presented a very different urban landscape compared to Moscow.
The elegant canals, imperial buildings and Italianate architecture gave St. Petersburg a very European feel. Attractions like the Hermitage and Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood were visually stunning. 
While St. Petersburg had its own unique charms, in my opinion Moscow still remained the pulsating heart and epicenter of contemporary Russian culture. Both cities together provided wonderful insights into the rich historical evolution and diverse sights across European Russia.
### The Surprising Hospitality of Local Russians
One thing that really surprised me during my trip was the unexpected warmth and friendliness shown by everyday Moscow residents. Contrary to initial expectations, I found regular Russians to be quite approachable and welcoming towards foreigners like myself.
While it's true some kept to themselves in public, many more seemed happy to engage in conversations about life, travel and our differing cultures over a friendly cup of coffee. Locals went out of their way to recommend secret spots and share little-known facts that enriched my experience enormously. 
This friendly spirit challenged some preconceived notions I had about Russians appearing aloof or cold. In truth, their hospitality made me feel instantly at home. I left Russia with exceptionally warm memories and new friends from unexpected chance encounters across the city.
### Top Things to Do in Moscow and St Petersburg
In summary, Moscow and St Petersburg are simply awe-inspiring cities that should top any travel itinerary for those visiting European Russia. Some recommendations for the top Must-See attractions include:
- The Red Square and St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow's historic heart 
- Admiring the treasures of the world-famous Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg
- Wandering through the opulent palaces and gold-domed churches of the Kremlin
- Riding Moscow's gorgeous metro system to aesthetic underground stations
- Appreciating iconic architecture along Nevsky Prospekt in St Petersburg
- Visiting the serene Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood 
- Catching performances of Russian ballet and opera in grand theaters
I hope my experiences provide some useful insights for planning your own unforgettable trip to these magnificent cities in the fascinating country of Russia.
