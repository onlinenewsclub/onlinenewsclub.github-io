### Vancouver Island and Victoria
I started my trip by taking a ferry boat from British Columbia to Vancouver Island. I was lucky to get the last room available at a small hotel in **Victoria, British Columbia, Canada**. Victoria has maintained its British heritage, so I enjoyed some classic [British fish and chips](https://vsmarts.github.io/categories/) for dinner. The next day, I visited the beautiful **Buchart Gardens**, a former gravel pit transformed into incredible gardens illuminated at night.

### Through the Canadian Rockies 
Taking the ferry back to the mainland, I got on the Trans Canada Highway heading east. The majestic **Canadian Rocky Mountains** truly took my breath away. Rogers Pass was abundant with **buffalo sightings**. At stunning Lake Louise, I stood awestruck gazing at the immense **glacier-fed lake**. To this day, vivid memories of the dramatic alpine scenery remain fresh in my mind from that 1971 trip.  
### Calgary and the Prairies  
Calgary, Alberta has evolved into a bustling commercial hub while preserving its western **cowboy culture**. Driving further east across the vast plains of Alberta and Manitoba, the landscape sharply contrasted the mountains. On clear days, the horizon stretched for miles of vast open fields of **corn, wheat and other cash crops**.
### Lake Superior and Home
I concluded this leg by driving along the northern shore of massive Lake Superior. After crossing into the USA over the impressive **Mackinac Bridge**, I was only about eight hours from home. Not wanting to wait another day or two as planned, I surprised my family with an early return by just walking through the door unannounced.
### Oregon's Coastal Beauty 
The entire Oregon coast offers spectacular natural beauty dotted with some of the most impressive bridges built during the **Works Progress Administration (WPA) era**. Before leaving Washington, a visit to scenic Olympic National Park is worthwhile, especially Hurricane Ridge and the **temperate rainforests**.  
### Central Oregon versus the Coast
Squeezing in Crater Lake along the scenic coastal route would require extensive driving. While Interstate 5 through central Oregon lacks comparable coastal scenery, it maximizes time on the coast. The vibrant city of Portland and its majestic **rose gardens** and iconic **Powell's Books** provide a charming urban contrast to the rural terrain.
### Highlights of Northern California  
Crossing into California, don't miss the famed **Avenue of the Giants** south of Eureka, featuring some of the tallest and oldest trees. Blimp hangars, **sea lion** colonies and classic **lighthouses** further highlight the incredible coastline before San Francisco. 
### Choosing a Region of Western Canada
With two weeks to explore Canada, focusing on one region is best. Options include Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, the Prairies, or western Alberta and British Columbia. Each spans a full day's drive to cross. Last year, my brother and I drove almost 1000 miles through southern Alberta and British Columbia over four scenic days. National parks like Jasper, Banff and lesser-known Waterton offer stunning alpine getaways within a day's drive of major cities. Western Canada presents endless possibilities for unforgettable scenery, activities and wildlife encounters off the beaten path.
