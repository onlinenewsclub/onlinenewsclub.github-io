## João Pessoa: Culture and Coastline of Northeast Brazil
The capital of Paraíba state on Brazil's northeastern coast, **João Pessoa** is a gateway to experience the vibrancy of the region. Sample fried fish, shrimp moqueca stew, and other fruits-of-the-sea while overlooking the ocean. Absorb the energetic rhythms of **forró**, a traditional dance genre, performing at live shows. Admire the historic center's well-preserved colonial architecture before relaxing on the pleasant shorelines of Tambaú and Cabo Branco. Nature lovers can spot humpback whales or explore the surrounding Cabo Branco State Park, home to rare estuarine ecosystems.
## Goiânia: Heart of Brazil's Inland Region
