### Visiting the Historic Gardens
Suzhou is famous for its elegant classical gardens, which have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The **Humble Administrator's Garden** (Zhuozhen Garden), also known as the largest garden in Suzhou, should not be missed. With acres of ponds, pavilions and stone bridges, wandering through this garden is like stepping back into ancient China. Another notable garden is the [Lion Forest Garden](https://thetopnews.github.io/does-the-xbox-elite-controller-support-bluetooth-connectivity/) located on the shores of beautiful Taihu Lake, known for its unique rock formations and sculptures of lions throughout the property.

### Strolling Along the Ancient Waterways
To experience Suzhou's canal culture, take a walk along **Pingjiang Road** and **Shangtang Street**. Lined with gardens, bridges and restaurants serving local cuisine, these historic streets come alive at night with vibrant night markets. You can sample delicious snacks like Sonicflower Beef, Suzhou Soup Dumplings and Rice Noodles while gazing at the flowing canals. For great views over the waterways, climb the **Tiger Hill Pagoda** where the famous poet Su Shi once wrote poems admiring the scenic city views. 
### Exploring the Modern District
Venture to the **Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP)** to experience the modern side of the city. Walk along beautiful **Jinji Lake** and visit the towering **Oriental Pearl TV Tower** for panoramic night views. The massive **Suzhou Centre Mall** houses over 500 shops, multiplex cinemas and an ice rink under one roof. You'll find every global cuisine represented here from **Japanese teppanyaki** to **Mexican tacos**. Don't miss the nightly music fountains displayed outside. Nearby **Li Gong Di** also offers high-end dining, boutique shops and waterside promenades.
### Browsing the Bookshelves  
Bookworms will enjoy browsing through **Chengping Bookstore**, the largest bookstore in SIP stocking Chinese and international titles. Alternatively, visit the historic **Eslite Bookstore** located in the heart of Suzhou old town, renowned as the first international five-star bookstore in mainland China. Wander through its shelves, relax over coffee and peruse interesting publications.
### Relaxing in Gardens and Parks
When you need an escape from the bustling streets, retreat to the peaceful **Soochow University Botanical Garden**. Stroll through Japanese gardens, pavilions and greenhouses spotting plant specimens. Alternatively, head to **Yuanrong Park** to observe local life - from dancing groups and taichi exercises to families enjoying picnic lunches. **Meiyuan Stream** inspired many great poets and artists over the centuries with its natural greenery and flowing water.
### Experiencing Water Town Culture
No visit is complete without exploring the ancient **water town** quarters. Board a miniature cruise boat from Chinese Folk Customs Village to float past historic bridges and courtyard homes. Marvel at the intricate alleyways lined with hanging signboards. Learn about the local culture, architecture and crafts like silk embroidery. Indulge in famous snacks like lotus root paste while wandering the scenic moatways. It's easy to get lost in this enchanting water-bound world for hours.
### Learning More from a Local

Jingyi can arrange private walking tours through the old alleys, explain local traditions or recommend the best spots for Sushi, bubble tea and local specialties off the tourist trail.
