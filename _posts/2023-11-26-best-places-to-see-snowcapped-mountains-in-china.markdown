### [Beautiful Snowcapped Mountain Scenery in Lhasa](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-ubca8-ub77c-ub8e8-uc2a4-uc5ec-ud589-uc548-uc804-uac00-uc774-ub4dc/)
Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, offers visitors breathtaking views of the snowcapped Himalayan Mountains. Situated at an elevation of over 11,000 feet, Lhasa enjoys mild weather from mid-September through mid-October. During this period, daytime temperatures range from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit without extremes of heat or cold. Nights may dip into the freezing range but are generally quite comfortable. This moderate early autumn climate makes it an ideal time to take in the majestic mountain landscapes without heavy rainfall or frigid conditions. 
From Lhasa, travelers can easily arrange day trips to view the iconic snow-capped peaks of Mt. Nyenchen Kanggadze and Mt. Nyenchen Thanglha that tower over the city. For an even more impressive mountain panorama, a guided tour to Yamdrok Tso, a high altitude lake surrounded by glacier-covered mountains, takes visitors' breath away. The pristine blue waters and snow-dusted peaks reflect off the lake creating magical scenes straight out of a painting. Tibet's natural beauty and unique Buddhist culture come together to provide a truly uplifting scenic mountain experience.

### **"**Urumqi: Gateway to China's Snowy Mountains"** 
Located in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, Urumqi serves as the entry point for visitors hoping to behold China's legendary snowcapped mountains. As the capital city of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Urumqi enjoys a more temperate climate than other northern Chinese cities thanks to its elevation of around 3,000 feet. On clear days in the city itself, one can catch glimpses of the towering Tian Shan mountain range in the distance, their white glacier tops gleaming brilliantly against the deep blue sky.   
For **unobstructed views of snowy peaks**, it is best to venture out of the urban center. A short drive leads to areas with even more spectacular mountain scenery. At Kanas Lake, over 150 miles from Urumqi, visitors can hike trails with panoramic vistas of the enchanting Kanas Shan range. On the way, stops at colorful alpine meadows and rushing mountain streams add to the rugged natural beauty. For the boldest mountain explorers, a multi-day trekking tour amongst Xinjiang's highest elevations at Altay offers pristine wilderness and solitude amongst towering glacier-carved rocks and valleys.
### **Experience Fairyland-like Scenery in Lijiang**
Nestled in the rugged terrain of Yunnan Province lies the picturesque mountain town of Lijiang. At an elevation of nearly 8,000 feet, Lijiang enjoys mild and generally dry conditions year-round. This southern location spares it the frigid winters experienced further north while its mountain-wrapped setting still allows for snowcapped peaks very close by.
Just a short drive from the historic streets of Lijiang Old Town brings visitors to the base of Yulong Xue Shan (Jade Dragon Snow Mountain). Rising majestically over 13,000 feet, this iconic mountain's snow-dusted ridges and formations resemble a scene straight out of a storybook fairyland. Multiple viewpoints along scenic highways like the Black Dragon Pool Park and Baisha Village offer photographic backdrops of the ethereal snow-white mountain against deep azure skies. For the more adventurous, winter travel allows snow sports like skiing and snowboarding on the mountain's fresh powdery slopes. The fairytale mountain vistas combined with Lijiang's friendly ambiance make it a top choice for viewing China's natural snowy scenery.
### **Picturesque Snow Views Year-Round in Yangshuo**
While not boasting alpine heights itself, the lyrical landscapes surrounding Yangshuo offer a photographer's delight of snowy peaks. Nestled in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's stunning karst formations, Yangshuo enjoys a mild subtropical climate. However, it lies just a short distance from the looming snowcrowed summit of **Mt. Li River Towering Peak**. 
Throughout winter, spring and even into summer, this peak's glacier-etched ridges and towering rock spires remain dusted in white snow. Photographers will want to set up camp along thescenic Li River where reflections of the peak shimmer off the winding waters. Early morning light creates magical scenes of mist and ripples highlighting the jagged snowy contours. For a closer perspective, guided hiking circuitslead up through rural villages with periodic viewpoints of the dramatic mountain rising majestically from the surroundinglevels of karst pinnacles. Yangshuo's lush karstland scenery paired with the magnificence of this perpetually snowy summit make it a unique mountain photo destination.
### **Scenic Snow Views Year-Round in Nagqu**
Located deep in the Tibetan Plateau region of Qinghai Province lies the prefecture-level city of Nagqu. At an average elevation exceeding 12,000 feet, Nagqu enjoys a cool temperate climate throughout the year. However, its vicinity to the mighty Himalayas means snowcapped peaks are always within view. 
Chief amongst the eye-catching mountains visible from Nagqu is the revered **Gurla Mandhata**. Towering over 20,000 feet, this peak's majestic snowy slopes never fully melt even in mid-summer. On clear days, its dazzling white glacial flanks glowing against bright cobalt skies can be seen from all areas of the Nagqu grasslands. In addition, many scenic spots and viewpoints along roads leading north towards the mountain offer photo ops to fully frame the summit's grandeur. For the most breathtaking perspectives, off-road camping adventures deep into the Nagqu prairie allow waking to surreal sunrises painting the eternal snow mountain in soft alpine hues. Nagqu's sublime mountain vistas rank it as a top year-round snow viewing destination in China. 
### **Take in Glacier Views from ledong, Hainan Island** 
Although located hundreds of miles south of mainland China, the tropical province of Hainan Island still offers opportunities to view snowcapped peaks. Nestled within the volcanic Wuzhi Mountains in the western region of Ledong lies **Mt. Yabuling National Park**. Despite Hainan's average temperature exceeding 80 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, Yabuling's summit rises majestically to over 5,300 feet and is graced with a permanently glaciated section on its north face.
Multiple hiking circuits lead up through lush subtropical jungle to scenic lookouts with panoramic perspectives across Hainan Bay towards Yabuling's gleaming white ice fields. During winter months when northern areas of China see heavy snows, the sight of Yabuling's glacier against the warm azure waters creates a striking tropical alpine contrast. While Hainan's humidity precludes serious mountaineering, day hikes to appreciate this rare tropical glacier remain a highlight. Ledong's proximity to Yabuling makes it the premier spot in China to glimpse a snow-covered peak from a balmy climate.   
### **Witness Snowcapped Peaks from Dali's Lush Valleys**  
Nestled within Yunnan's Cangshan Mountains lies the scenic town of Dali. At around 8,000 feet elevation, Dali enjoys a generally balmy and humid climate courtesy of its southern setting. However, nearby snowcapped peaks including **Cangshan Mountain** and **Jizushan Mountain** rise dramatically to over 13,000 feet, holding small glacial remnants well into summer.
From throughout Dali's idyllic rural valleys and paddy fields, the towering white-frosted ridges of these mountains form an epic backdrop. Postcard-perfect scenes present themselves during early mornings as valley mists rise to frame the majestic snowy silhouettes. Near Erhai Lake, spectacular reflections of the peaks shimmer across the placid turquoise waters. While light mountain hiking leads up through bamboo and tea plantations for closer perspectives, simply soaking in these serene landscape panoramas helps visitors feel connected to Dali's wild natural heritage. Its juxtaposition of agricultural charm and close proximity to astounding mountain vistas make Dali a picturesque base for snow viewing.
In closing, China's diversity provides many locales both northern and southern for taking in breathtaking mountain scenery adorned with perpetual winter snows. From Lhasa'sHimalayan giants to Yangshuo's karstland views, each destination offers a unique cultural and geographic experience alongside spellbinding natural alpine beauty. With prudent planning, travelers can discover spectacular snowcapped peaks throughout much of the year no matter the season across this vast and varied nation.
