### District Living Options and Schooling 
There are a few good district options for living in Shenzhen with kids while commuting to work in Dongguan one to two times per week. **Nanshan, Shekou, and Futian** are generally the top choices as they are the most developed areas with the highest quality of life. However, the commute time from these districts to Dongguan can be over an hour each way depending on traffic. Another suitable option closer to Dongguan is the [Longhua and Guanlan area](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-06-u963f-u5c14-u53ca-u5229-u4e9a-u65c5-u6e38-u6307-u5357/), which has better international school options like Mission Hills International School and is much closer for the commute. 
When choosing a district, factors like budget, proximity to international restaurants and amenities, and schooling plans should be considered. International school tuition is high, around $15,000-$30,000 USD annually depending on the school. Public schools in Shenzhen are improving but most classes are conducted in Mandarin. Living closer to Dongguan like in Longhua area provides a better daily commute but fewer international amenities and higher pollution levels compared to central Futian, Luohu or Nanshan.

### Daily Commute from Shenzhen to Dongguan Factory
With only needing to commute to the Dalang area of Dongguan one to two times per week, living in Shenzhen full-time is very feasible. The drive time along **Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway from Longhua to Dalang** can be under an hour depending on traffic. Public transportation like the metro and buses in both cities also provide commute options. From central Shenzhen districts, allow 90 minutes or more for the drive during peak hours. 
Using the commute time efficiently for work is recommended. Having reliable internet access from the Shenzhen apartment allows connecting with the Dongguan factory remotely for things like **product development, sourcing, packaging design, shipping logistics** and more on non-commute days. Leveraging Shenzhen's strengths in these areas can help maximize productivity while being based in Shenzhen close to quality international schools.
### Apartment Rental Budget and Amenities 
For a comfortable living situation, aim to budget **$1,500-$2,000 USD** or more per month for a furnished 2-3 bedroom apartment, especially in prime central locations like Futian or Luohu near the ports. Apartments in Longhua tend to be about 20% cheaper on average. Western-style supermarkets and international restaurants are readily available in central areas but limited in outlying districts. 
Look for apartments with fast fiber internet, international cable TV, gym/pool access, and comfort amenities like a washer/dryer, dishwasher and central air conditioning desirable for families. Gated compounds with security provide peace of mind. Furnished short-term leases of 6-12 months provide flexibility if plans change. Agents like ERA can help navigate the rental process and accommodate language/cultural needs.
### Education and Activities for Kids
Top international schools in Shenzhen accept students from pre-K through high school graduation and offer IB, AP or Canadian/American curriculum. Annual tuition for these top-tier schools averages **$20,000-30,000 USD** and often requires waiting lists. They provide rich extracurricular activities, modern facilities and prepare students for top universities worldwide. 
Alternatives include cheaper international Christian schools, public schools plus international tutoring/activities, or border-hopping to schools just across the Hong Kong border. Local communities also organize kids sports, music, art and language programs. Weekend activities abound, from theme parks and indoor playgrounds to family-friendly tourist spots along the city's greenways. Living centrally near these resources enhances quality of life.
### Long-term Flexibility and Returns to Hong Kong
While initially committing to a 1-2 year lease, aim for an apartment location and school choice that allows flexibility if the family situation changes. For example, living in Luohu versus Longhua provides easier access to Hong Kong via the bridges and tunnels for **returns to family, travel or business**. Hong Kong's top international schools may also become an option as kids get older, benefiting from Hong Kong's world-class education system. 
With 1-2 day weekly visits to Dongguan only, living primarily in vibrant Shenzhen provides excellent quality of life and support system for foreign families while remaining close to the Chinese mainland market and supply chain. Overall, with proper planning, Shenzhen is very suitable as a long-term home base.
