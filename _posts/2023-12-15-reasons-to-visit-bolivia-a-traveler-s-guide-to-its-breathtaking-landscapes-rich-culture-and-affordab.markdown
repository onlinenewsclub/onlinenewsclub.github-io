## Part 3 - Death Road Mountain Biking
For adrenaline-lovers, brave the infamous **North Yungas Road**, dubbed the "World's Most Dangerous Road". This 65km ride hugs sheer cliff edges over 1000m above the Amazon basin floor. Though no longer suitable for vehicles, the road remains a iconic mountain biking challenge. Gravity Assisted Tours offer guided rides down the perilous route for a heart-pumping adventure.
