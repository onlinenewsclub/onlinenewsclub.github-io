The country of China holds so many wonders to discover. As a foreigner from Europe who has lived and worked in China for several years now, I have gained a profound appreciation for this amazing nation. Though I once held numerous misconceptions and biases about China prior to my visit, experiencing it firsthand shattered many preconceived notions. Through my own daily life and travels across the country, I have come to understand what truly makes China such a great place to live.
### [A Safe and Affordable Way of Life](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-08-vacances-de-4-jours-xe0-paris-itin-xe9raire-id-xe9al-pour-profiter-de-la-ville-lumi-xe8re/) 
Living in China has provided me with a peaceful and low-cost standard of living. I never worry about safety issues like crime or violence during my daily routines. The cost of housing, food, and other necessities allows me to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle on just 5000 RMB (about $700 USD) per month. This level of affordability combined with stability has allowed me to focus fully on my career without financial concerns. As someone managing a chronic health condition, the universally accessible healthcare system has also given me great security.

### **Opportunities for Career Growth and Tax Benefits**
My job here has opened doors for professional growth. Salaries are generous and paid reliably. As an expat from a country with a tax treaty, I also enjoy tax-free status on my income in China. This significant tax break enhances my earnings potential. The thriving job market supplies plenty of career options across various industries. Skilled foreigners like myself find our talents in high demand.
### **A Culinary Paradise Riches with Culture** 
No one can deny China's **masterful cuisine**. As someone who loves to eat, discovering new regional specialties has been one of my favorite parts of living here. I'm constantly amazed by the creativity, artistry, and subtle flavors of Chinese cooking. Whether dining out or ordering in, meals provide an affordable luxury. Beyond food, China offers a profound cultural heritage reflected through its diverse architecture, customs, arts, and historical sites. Immersing myself in this rich cultural landscape has been an enlightening experience.
### **Convenient Connectivity in the Digital Age**
China has truly embraced cutting-edge **technology infrastructure**. Near-effortless cashless payments through systems like WeChat Pay make daily transactions quick and hassle-free. Online retail giants like Taobao allow people amazing convenience in online shopping for everything imaginable. High-speed rail, world-class airports, and modern metros provide efficient transportation options across vast distances. As a digital nomad, this level of connectivity ensures I can work from anywhere seamlessly.
### **Unparalleled Natural Beauty Across the Nation**
Beyond urban innovation, exploring China's natural wonders has been a highlight. Places like Zhangjiajie, with its towering quartzite sandstone pillars and vertigo-inducing suspended walkways, stand as some of the most magnificent landscapes on earth. I've also been awestruck by the water towns of southern China, like Zhouzhuang, with their shimmering canals, stone bridges and architecture dating back centuries. The diversity of incredible scenery from towering mountains to colorful rice terraces to subtropical rainforests prove China's stunning variety.
### **Learning a Fascinating Language and Culture**   
Studying Mandarin Chinese has allowed rich cultural immersion. Living in China provides the ideal environment for accelerating language skills through daily practice and cultural osmosis. Being surrounded by conversations, menus, signs and more in Chinese keeps me engaged in active learning. Attending local language exchanges and cultural activities further deepens understanding. The friendly and encouraging nature of Chinese people towards foreigners trying to learn their language creates a highly motivating setting.
### **A Global Leader on the Rise**
After experiencing life in China firsthand, it's easy to see why this nation is ascending on the world stage at such a breakneck pace. What was once an unfamiliar and misunderstood country revealed itself as innovative, ambitious and culturally rich. Though imperfect like any country, China's unparalleled progress over recent decades in developing infrastructure, technology, standards of living and global influence inspire admiration. Having witnessed this remarkable transformation up close, it's clear China will only continue growing its vital role in shaping our interconnected future.
