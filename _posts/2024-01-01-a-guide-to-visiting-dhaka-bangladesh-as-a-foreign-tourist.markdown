## Welcome to Dhaka
Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, is a bustling metropolis located along the banks of the Buriganga River. As the political and economic center of the country, Dhaka attracts thousands of visitors each year. While Bangladesh has a predominantly Muslim culture, the people of Dhaka are renowned for their hospitality towards tourists. As a foreign visitor to Dhaka, you can expect a warm welcome from locals wherever you go.
### Getting Around the City  
With over 8 million inhabitants, Dhaka is one of the largest and most densely populated cities in the world. However, as in many large Asian cities, getting around need not be complicated once you understand the transportation systems. Auto-rickshaws or CNGs (compressed natural gas powered three-wheelers) are ubiquitous and affordable for short journeys across the city. Buses and public minibuses cover longer routes, while ride-hailing services such as Uber and Pathao offer door-to-door transportation at reasonable rates. For tourists, hiring a vehicle with an English-speaking driver is recommended to navigate places easily.

### Must-See Attractions in Old Dhaka
Old Dhaka, the historic quarter located south of the Buriganga River, is a fascinating area steeped in Mughal-era architecture and culture. Some of the top sights here include the **600-year-old Baitul Mukarram National Mosque**, the largest mosque in Bangladesh housing the mausoleum of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Closeby is the [Ahsan Manzil](https://thetopnews.github.io/pok-xe9mon-through-the-generations-a-sister-s-story/) or Pink Palace, a magnificent royal residential mansion showcasing the ornate lifestyles of the Nawabs of Dhaka in the late 19th century.

## Respecting Local Customs and Norms
When visiting a new country, it is important to be mindful of local cultural norms and customs. In conservative Bangladeshi society, certain behaviors are deemed disrespectful or offensive. As the majority follows Islam, tourists should dress modestly covering shoulders and knees, avoid public displays of affection, and refrain from consuming alcohol in public areas. It is also advisable not to photograph people without permission to respect individuals' privacy. 
### Interacting with Locals Respectfully
Most Bangladeshis are very warm and helpful towards visitors, eager to assist tourists navigating the city. However, understand they come from a culture that values humility, patience and modesty in interactions. Avoid aggressive bargaining when shopping and tipping is not expected, though small acts of kindness and smiles will go a long way in making positive impressions. When asking for directions or assistance, using polite formal terms like "please" and "thank you" in Bengali helps break the ice respectfully. 
### Cultural Etiquette at Mosques 
As places of worship, mosques require maintaining decorum and following certain protocols for entry. For tourists of other faiths, it is respectful to ask permission from mosque authorities before visiting or photographing the premises. Footwear must be removed before entering prayer areas. Men and women should dress very modestly covering full body and sleeves. Avoid loud noises and conversations that may disturb those in worship. Cultural sensitivity and respect for local traditions will ensure smooth experiences visiting these significant religious sites.
