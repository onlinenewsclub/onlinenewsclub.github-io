## Insight into DC's Past and Present through Iconic Sites
When planning a trip to Washington DC, visiting some of the most iconic historic sites is a must to gain insight into both the past and present of the nation's capital. Two sites that should not be missed are the National Archives and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. 
At the National Archives, visitors can see original documents like the [United States Constitution](https://thetopnews.github.io/inside-the-games-industry-challenges-rewards-and-career-options/) and Bill of Rights that formed the foundation of America. Seeing these historical artifacts in person is a unique way to understand the core values the country was built upon. 
The National Museum of African American History and Culture meanwhile tells the important story of the **African American experience** through diverse exhibitions and artifacts. It illustrates both the struggles and triumphs of Black history and culture in a way that is educational and moving. 
Beyond these two places, other iconic monuments like the **Lincoln Memorial**, **Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial**, **Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial**, and the **Vietnam Veterans Memorial** also offer poignant glimpses into pivotal moments in American history through impressive structures and tributes.
## Additional Historic Sites and Activities 
There are several other notable sites that provide valuable historical context about Washington DC. The **United States Holocaust Memorial Museum** commemorates the horrors of the Holocaust through a deeply moving exhibit. 
On a lighter note, strolling along the tranquil Tidal Basin where the iconic **Cherry Blossom Festival** takes place each spring offers beautiful views of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Another fun, educational activity is spending a day at the **National Zoo** learning about conservation efforts and witnessing animal behaviors up close through various exhibits and species. 
## Popular Tour Options to Experience DC 
With so many historical attractions spread throughout the city, tour buses and trolleys are one of the best ways to efficiently visit multiple sites. Two of the most popular options are the Old Town Trolley and Big Bus tours. 
### Old Town Trolley Tours
The Old Town Trolley offers hop-on hop-off tours where passengers can board and disembark freely at any of the nearly 30 stops around the city. Onboard narratives provide context about landmarks as the trolley passes by. **Audio guide** options in multiple languages make the tours accessible for international visitors.

### Big Bus Tours 
Like the trolley, Big Bus tours allow passengers to explore at their own pace with hop-on hop-off access. However, the double decker buses have the added benefit of an **upper level open-air viewing deck** for incredible panoramic views. Narrated stories bring sites to life while passing through neighborhoods.
## Specialty and Insider Tours
While the hop-on hop-off options cover the major landmarks, smaller specialty tours offer a more in-depth, behind-the-scenes experience.
