Tokyo is a fascinating city with a unique culture. Here are some helpful insights to best enjoy your trip to this amazing metropolitan destination.
## Attire and Style
Dress conservatively when visiting Tokyo. **long pants, polo shirts, wind breakers** are suitable for men. For women, **medium length skirts, slacks, blouses** work well. Jeans are okay if they don't have too many holes. Most Japanese dress modestly and avoid standing out too much in public. Stick to neutral colors like **black, navy, tan, and white** to better blend in. Bring comfortable, broken-in shoes for all the walking you'll do sightseeing.  
### Pack for Removal of Shoes
You'll frequently be asked to remove your shoes when entering homes or places like temples. Keep slip-on shoes handy for these situations. Also wear socks without holes to be polite.

### Dress for Warm Weather
If visiting in summer, Japanese women typically avoid sun exposure, so you may not see many [sleeveless tops or shorts](https://thetopnews.github.io/vr-gaming-on-consoles-possibilities-and-limitations/). As a foreigner, it's fine to dress for the weather, just be aware you may stand out more. 
## Communication and Etiquette
Learn a few basic Japanese phrases to ask for help respectfully. Writing things down or using a translation app is better than loud speaking if others don't understand you. Smiles and friendly body language go a long way. Always be respectful and follow local customs.
### Remove Shoes and Bow Politely  
Slip shoes off when entering homes or temples. Bow slightly as a polite greeting. Be mindful of your volume and don't speak loudly in public.
### Don't Rely on English
Very few Japanese speak English fluently, so try communicating in their language to the best of your ability. Have patience, use gestures, and be grateful for any assistance. 
## Getting Around Tokyo
Walk everywhere you can to experience the city. Wear **broken-in shoes** to prevent blisters. Public transit is very efficient but crowded during rush hour. Consider alternate routes to avoid the biggest stations at peak times. 
### Use Convenient Stores (Konbini) 
These ubiquitous convenience stores offer ATMs, snacks, drinks and cheap umbrellas. Purchase a rechargeable transport card to easily pay for buses and subway. 
### Ride the Shinkansen Bullet Train
This high-speed rail network connects major cities. It's a scenic and comfortable way to travel longer distances across Honshu island. 
### Take a Taxi for Long Distances
Taxis are very clean, safe and professional but expensive for short trips. Consider them for trips from airports or longer journeys instead of multiple transit connections.  
### cycle and Walk whenever Possible
Bicycles are a common mode of transport in Tokyo and cyclists frequently ride on walkways. Watch for them when walking on sidewalks. Try gentle strolling to take in neighborhood streets and scenery.
## Food and Dining 
Exceptional quality and service are baseline expectations at restaurants. Enjoy the amazing variety of cuisines found everywhere at very reasonable price points. 
### Eat At Convenience Stores
Konbini food like onigiri rice balls, snacks and drinks offer inexpensive and easy grab-and-go options. These stores frequently have clean restrooms too.
### Try unique Regional Specialties
Osaka is renowned for okonomiyaki savory pancakes. Other cities have their iconic dishes too worth seeking out. Markets sell tempting street foods and fresh local produce. 
### Celebrate with KFC on Christmas 
Instead of traditional holiday meals, Japanese enjoy festive fried chicken from KFC thanks to an longtime advertising campaign. Lines form in advance to grab buckets on December 25th.
## Safety, Laws and Etiquette 
Tokyo has an extremely low crime rate. You can feel very safe carrying cash and using public transit. Be respectful of rules against activities like public drinking, smoking in some areas or talking loudly on trains. Always be polite and courteous to others. With a little cultural awareness, you can have a wonderful, safe experience exploring Japan!
