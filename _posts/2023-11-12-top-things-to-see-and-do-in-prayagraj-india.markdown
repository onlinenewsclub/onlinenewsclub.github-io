## Divine Confluence 
The holy city of Prayagraj is renowned as one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites in India. At the heart of it all is Triveni Sangam, where the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati Rivers converge. Thousands of devotees visit daily to bathe in the sacred waters and pray. During large religious festivals like Kumbh Mela, millions make the pilgrimage here to ritually cleanse themselves. 
### Experience the Divine at Sangam
Triveni Sangam is a breathtaking sight to behold. The meeting of the "three pathways" is especially auspicious for Hindus, who believe bathing here cleanses sins and brings one closer to moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). Don't miss [visiting the Lete Hue Hanumanji temple](https://thetopnews.github.io/building-a-roblox-account-from-the-ground-up-a-comprehensive-guide/) and **Patalpuri temples** located right on the sangam's banks.
