One prominent figure in Tianjin's history was Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary and Olympic gold medalist immortalized in the film _Chariots of Fire_. After retiring from athletics, Liddell returned to Tianjin in the 1920s to serve as a missionary teacher. He lived at 38 Chongqing Dao, a unique **red-brick house** that still stands today. Nearby is the Minyuan Stadium, which Liddell helped design in 1926 based on London's Stamford Bridge stadium. Both sites reflect the significant missionary presence in early 20th century Tianjin. 
Another landmark from this era is the former Zhongfa Assembly Hall, originally the Jewish Synagogue built in the 1890s. Its Italian Renaissance-style architecture underscores the diverse foreign investment and residential communities that existed in the international concession areas of Tianjin. Nearby is the former site of the Concordia Club, a social club for Germans constructed in 1907 showcasing early 20th century **Western-style architecture**.

### **Riverside Promenades and Scenic Overlooks** 
One of the best ways to experience Tianjin is along its riverside promenades. The most prominent river is the **Hai River system**, several interconnected waterways that flow through the city.

Two whimsical sculptures on the bridge, including an "opening shell" symbolic of Venus, were added in the 1970s and add artistic touches. Further downriver, riverfront parks like Gugong Park offer peaceful respite among flowers and greenery.
For panoramic city views, head to the Shengjing St. area with its elevated walkways. On a clear night, the dazzling skyline shimmers with lights, while during the day the wide vistas take in historic and modern architecture. Nearby Gugong Park and Gugong Museum Hill provide additional scenic spots to appreciate Tianjin's natural beauty and historical significance from a higher perspective.
### **Heritages of Former Concessions and International Influences**

Moving east, the Italian concession area centered along Binjiang Dao features Italianate architecture and the charming St. Joseph's Church. Nearby is the former site of the Concordia Club.
Traces of Judaism also remain - the Ohel Moshe Synagogue, the last remaining in North China, operates as a small museum. To the southwest lies the former Japanese concession area with stately Japanese-style buildings like Wudadao Police Station. These internationally influenced neighborhoods showcase the cosmopolitan nature of early 20th century Tianjin.
