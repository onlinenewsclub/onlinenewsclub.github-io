## Safe Neighborhoods to Stay In Lima 
Miraflores is one of the safest and most tourist-friendly neighborhoods in Lima. It has a great nightlife along with nearby ruins you can visit. Hotels in Miraflores provide a safe central location to explore the city from. 
The area of **Jirón De La Union**, in historic colonial Lima, is becoming safer as it undergoes gentrification. New cafes and restaurants have opened, attracting more visitors to the area. However, it's still best to only visit during the daytime until it's more established.
The artsy district of Barranco has a thriving nightlife scene with good restaurants and bars. As long as you stick to the main streets, it's relatively safe to walk around at night in Barranco and enjoy the nightlife scene.
### Avoid Isolated Areas
When going outside of the tourist areas, be extremely vigilant of your surroundings. Many neighborhoods in Lima have high poverty and crime rates. Avoid isolated streets, parks, or neighborhoods that seem deserted. It's best to only visit during the day and stay in areas with other people around.

### Use Licensed Taxis 
Never get into an unlicensed taxi, as some have been known to rob or ransom their passengers. Only use taxis from official stands at hotels, restaurants, or airports. You can also use rideshare apps like Uber which provide a safer, tracked transportation option.
## Safety Tips When Traveling Around Lima
### Be Aware of Your Belongings
Do not flash expensive cameras, jewelry, or leave valuables unattended where they can be easily stolen. Opportunistic thieves will snatch anything they see as a chance. Keep valuables concealed when not in use.
### Watch for Followers 
In poorer neighborhoods, be very aware of anyone behind you. Make abrupt turns or go into a shop if the same people keep trailing you, to avoid possible confrontation or theft.
### Avoid Isolated Cabs
Never get into a cab that randomly stops and offers you a ride, without being called by your hotel or rideshare service. Stick to official, licensed transportation.
### Inform Your Embassy
Before visiting, notify your country's embassy of your trip details and locations you'll be visiting. This can help in an emergency situation.
### Follow Local Precautions
Use the same safety practices you would in any urban environment with high poverty. Be vigilant but not paranoid. Most Limeños are friendly, just protect yourself from the few who seek to take advantage of tourists.
## Day Trips from Lima: Safer small towns and ruins
The towns and ruins outside of Lima make for great day trips to experience more of Peruvian culture safely.
### Colonial Arequipa 
Arequipa, known as the "White City," is one of the cleaner and safest small cities in Peru. Its beautifully preserved colonial architecture and central plaza make it a top destination just a few hours from Lima by plane. Walk around freely and enjoy the nightlife without much concern for safety.
### Folkloric Cañete 
The town of Cañete, a couple hours south of Lima by car, is famous for its preserved African cultural traditions. Take an organized folklore dinner show to experience the lively music and dancing without safety worries. Stick to guided excursions here. 
### Incan Wonders of Pachacamac 
One of the most well-preserved Inca ruins is located just 30 minutes outside of Lima. Pachacamac Archaeological Park has remains dating back over 1,500 years. Hire a licensed guide through your hotel to visit these ruins safely during daylight hours.
## Safest Activities in Lima
While general precautions apply, there are also specific low-risk activities tourists can enjoy in Lima:
### Guided Tours and Shows  
Take organized walking tours, food tours, dancing shows and museum visits arranged through reputable tour companies. Guides know the safest routes and can help if any issues arise.
### Top Museums
Spend the day exploring Lima's excellent museums like Larco Herrera for its gold and silver collection or Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia. Both are located in safe and busy areas.
### Parque del amor
Take a relaxing stroll through this lovely downtown park, where you'll find families and couples enjoying the paths and fountains. It's a great low-key outdoor space.
### Central Market District
Browse the busy markets of Lima like Mercado Central to observe the local culture and sample ceviche and anticuchos. Go during daylight hours and avoid isolated side streets.
By following basic safety precautions and avoiding risky areas after dark, visitors can experience the rich history and culture of Lima responsibly. With informed guidance, it remains one of the most fascinating cities in South America to explore.
