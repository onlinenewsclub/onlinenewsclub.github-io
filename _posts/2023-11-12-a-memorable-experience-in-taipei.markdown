### [Finding a Lost Phone with Help from the Police](https://thelivenews.github.io/2023-10-13-the-rise-and-governance-of-the-habsburg-empire/)
It was a family trip to Taipei a couple years ago. One evening, I was out with a couple of Taiwanese ladies we met on the trip. They were also from out of town and staying in Taipei for the weekend. As we headed back to the hotel, which was conveniently near ours, I realized I had dropped my mobile phone in the taxi. 
While I thought all hope was lost, our new friend insisted on taking me to the nearest police station to report it. Though I thought this was just a formality with no chance of seeing my phone again, she persisted. The police officer kindly took my statement and obtained as many details as possible. He then began reviewing CCTV footage from intersections near our hotel, fast forwarding and rewinding to try and identify our taxi between 12:30-12:45am. Amazingly, after searching three junctions, we spotted a matching cab and identified the driver's record and contact information. The officer called the driver, who was now home, asking him to check his vehicle. Incredibly, my phone was found on the front seat. I was able to thank the officers and hail a cab to retrieve my lost device that very morning. This incredible act of kindness and community cooperation left a lasting impression.

### **An Uncomfortable Stroll Through an Unfamiliar Neighborhood** 
Another memorable experience in Taipei involved wandering lost down an unfamiliar street. I had been looking for a museum or attraction near the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall but became disoriented. After missing my stop on the bus, I ended up in an area I didn't recognize. Hugging the main roads, I passed houses in disrepair with graffiti, which made me uneasy given its rarity in Taipei. A couple arguing nearby further unsettled me when the man angrily dumped a bucket of water near me. Next, I saw a man with a rough appearance smoking, then another yelling aggressively into his phone. Feeling increasingly uncomfortable, I prayed to reach somewhere familiar. Finally spotting a bus stop, I realized I was in Taipei's Wanhua District, known for its past gang activity depicted in the film "Monga". Though likely exaggerating perceived dangers, the people and environment differed starkly from elsewhere in Taipei. It serves as a cautionary tale of being lost in an unfamiliar, seemingly rougher urban area without knowledge of local customs or language.
### **An Overall Safe and Helpful City**
Despite moments of discomfort, Taipei remains remarkably safe. Women face little threat walking alone at night. Lost items, like phones or wallets, often get handed in to police and efforts are made to reconnect with owners. Even pickpocketing and theft are quite rare given extensive CCTV coverage and low incentives for criminals. Common sense still applies but residents generally feel secure. In fact, some even forget basic safety like not missing their bus stop! While certain areas like late night KTV districts carry marginal increased risk, overall crime rates remain very low. This sense of security stems from Taiwanese social values emphasizing community, cooperation with authorities, and looking out for one another. Strange as it was to witness first hand, my experience regaining a lost phone exemplifies these qualities that define Taipei as a harmonious, helpful place to visit.
### **A Surprising Act of Kindness from Police and Community** 
The story of how my lost mobile phone was recovered still astonishes me to this day. After realizing it had fallen out of the taxi we took back to our hotel, I assumed it was gone for good in a city as huge as Taipei. However, our new Taiwanese friend insisted we make a report at the local police station instead of accepting the unlucky situation. There, the officer took the time to thoroughly review CCTV footage from intersections near our hotel in order to identify the taxi. Amazingly, they were able to determine the driver's identity and contact him, discovering the phone left behind on the seat. I will never forget the incredible care and diligence shown by everyone involved - from our friend who encouraged the police report, to the officer who went above and beyond, to the taxi driver who turned in the found item. Their selfless acts of collaboration represent the high **standard of service** and **community spirit** that make Taipei such a remarkable place to visit.
### **Exploring Taipei's Neighborhoods While Avoiding Unwanted Attention**
When visiting an unfamiliar international city, it's important to be aware of one's surroundings and avoid venturing down dodgy looking streets alone at night. While most areas of Taipei feel very safe, certain neighborhoods near tourist spots are best explored during daylight with a local friend familiar with the language and culture. For example, those wandering near Taipei's historic Wanhua District, known for its old temples and ancestral homes, would be wise to avoid back alleys in the evening as depicted in the gritty crime film "Monga". Sticking to well-lit main roads with other people around helps prevent unwanted stares from unsavory characters as in my own experience. Using maps and public transportation carefully can also circumvent getting lost down winding lanes lacking other foreigners or English signs. With basic precautions, visitors can fully appreciate Taipei's diverse neighborhoods while avoiding any unnecessary uneasy feelings.
### **A Welcoming City Where Strangers Become Friends**
My memorable family trip to Taipei was made all the better by the warm and friendly locals we encountered. On that first night out, two kind Taiwanese ladies took us under their wing despite being strangers ourselves, and we enjoyed lively conversation over dinner learning about each other's cultures and travels. Their act of bringing me to report my lost phone, going out of their way to help a foreigner in need, exemplifies the gracious and community-minded spirit of Taiwanese people. Even years later recounting these positive interactions brings a smile, a reminder of Taipei's ease in forging new connections. From police diligently reuniting owners and lost items, to everyday citizens looking out for each other, it's clear this city prioritizes harmony, hospitality and paying it forward - qualities that keep drawing visitors back time and again to experience its renowned charm.
### **A Safe Haven Appreciated by Return Visitors**
Having now travelled to Taipei on multiple occasions, I can say with confidence it remains one of the safest, most pleasant cities in Asia to explore. While that initial vulnerable experience losing my way in an unfamiliar working-class district made an impression, statistically crime rates remain extremely low. Women feel secure strolling alone and lost items typically find their way back to owners. Even briefly forgetting one's phone in a taxi resulted in a heartwarming recovery, a reminder of community cooperation. With its efficient transportation, ample green spaces, beckoning night markets, and friendly locals always quick with a smile, it's easy to see why so many return to Taipei again and again. In an unpredictable world, finding a welcoming refuge that prioritizes human decency remains deeply valued. Taipei has undoubtedly earned its reputation as one of Asia's premier destinations where comfort and compassion harmoniously coexist.
