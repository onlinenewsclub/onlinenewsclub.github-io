Want to get away from the hustle and bustle? Head to Parque das Mangabeiras, a lush nature reserve at the end of Avenida Afonso Pena that feels worlds away from the city. Take a leisurely stroll along walking trails winding through dense forests and enjoy spotting native birds and wildlife. This is the perfect place to decompress on weekends, just be aware of crowds and daily closures on Mondays.

Tucked away in the Floresta neighborhood, Amadoria is a cultural gem hosting diverse programming from art exhibits to live music. Check their online calendar to find upcoming events and catch a **jazz concert** or photography show. While the surrounding area isn't the safest after dark, it is worth visiting during the day to experience cool underground culture in an unassuming part of town. 
### Vibrant Street Food Scene
Just outside the city lies Alameda Oscar Niemeyer, a trendy strip lined with restaurants and bars perfect for people watching. Grab a seat on the patio at L'amour Bistrot & Cabaret, renowned for French cuisine and **smooth jazz performances**. Meat lovers cannot go wrong with the monster-sized burgers and rich bacon at Duke n' Duke, where sandwiches bear the names of famous historical figures. Wander the avenue illuminated by lights from surrounding establishments long into the warm nights.
### Steep Hilltop Bars

Browse used book shops and hunt for rare vinyl then unwind over vegetarian small plates or craft beers surrounded by bohemian locals. Soak up decades of counterculture history within these brick walls.

Keep a respectful distance from the mischievous quati rodents known to scavenge snacks!
