### Chicago's Public Transportation System 
Chicago's public transportation system is one of the most comprehensive systems in the United States. The **Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)** operates bus and rapid transit train (metro and subway) services in the city of Chicago and some nearby suburbs with over 2,000 buses and 1,200 rail cars. The CTA has eight rapid transit rail lines with a total length of approximately 145 route miles reaching every corner of the city. It is very [convenient](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-04-voyage-autour-du-monde-xe0-pied/) to use the CTA to get around Chicago as most popular destinations like Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Navy Pier and museums are located close to CTA stations. Daily and multi-day CTA passes provide unlimited rides on buses and trains and are very affordable.

### Getting Around Downtown Chicago Without a Car
If you are staying in downtown Chicago, a car is absolutely unnecessary as everything is within **walking distance**. Downtown streets are pedestrian-friendly and the entire Magnificent Mile shopping district, Chicago Riverwalk, Millenium Park and Grant Park can be reached on foot. If the weather is not cooperable or the destination is a bit farther, Divvy bikes are available for short bike rides. Ubers and Lyfts are also plenty with lower surge pricing downtown. **On-demand rideshares** provide door-to-door transportation options other than CTA if you have heavy luggage or limited mobility. Parking downtown is expensive, at least $40-50 per day at hotel lots. Street parking is difficult to find and ticket fines can add up fast.
### Exploring Neighborhoods Beyond Downtown
While the CTA rail lines can get you close to many interesting neighborhoods like Wicker Park, Logan Square, Pilsen and West Town from downtown, the bus network is also extensive, reaching farther neighborhoods. Popular neighborhoods like **Lincoln Park, Lakeview** and Andersonville are directly served by several bus routes with frequent service. Installing the Ventra app allows you to easily track real-time bus arrivals and plan your routes. A Ventra transit card loaded with day passes eliminates the hassle of paying in cash each ride. For neighborhoods not directly served by CTA like Rogers Park, Edgewater, some **western suburbs**, ride-hailing services provide an affordable alternative to taxis or car rentals. 
### Day Trips Outside the City
For day trips outside Chicago limits to places like Oak Park, Evanston, **Navy Pier** and further suburbs, ride-hailing or car rental makes more sense than the CTA. Weekend and off-peak rental rates from major agencies like Enterprise, Hertz or Budget start from $30-50/day, which is cheaper than taking multiple Ubers or missing spontaneous trips. However, only rent if multiple suburban trips are planned or you have multiple people to split the rental cost. **South side** neighborhoods like Hyde Park are still very well connected by public transit from downtown. Driving in the city does have risks of parking tickets, high rates or accidents causing legal issues.
### Safety On Public Transit
While personal safety issues do occur rarely on some routes or stations, in general Chicago's public transportation system is very safe. The CTA utilizes safety awareness programs, security cameras on buses and in stations and emergency help points. Most stations are well lit and have police patrols. Sitting near the driver or in the first train car provides the best visibility and fastest driver assistance if needed. Using the Ventra app's **real-time arrivals** helps avoid long waits alone at less busy stations after dark. Following basic safety precautions like not flashing expensive items and being alert makes the CTA very usable for visitors. Chicago's overall crime rate has also dropped significantly in the **recent years**.
### Is a Car Rental Needed? 
In conclusion, whether a visitor truly needs a rental car depends on where they plan to stay and what activities are on their agenda. For a typical city vacation spent mostly downtown exploring attractions, neighborhoods and the lakefront on foot, public transit offers convenient access and parking headaches are avoided. Weekend or occasional ride-share use works well too. Only for visiting farther day-trip locations repeatedly should car rental be considered. Factoring in parking and gas costs, renting mainly benefits groups. Following basic safety precautions like situational awareness and using the Ventra app features keeps using Chicago's affordible, extensive public transportation system very safe and practical for most visitors.
