## Getting Around Paris 
### Using the Metro Like a Pro
The Paris metro is one of the most efficient ways to get around the city. Here are some tips for using it effectively:
**Get an offline metro map for your smartphone.** Having route maps accessible without an internet connection will make navigating the metro seamless. 
**Pass luggage through the gates before you.** The gates close quickly, so make sure any bags are through first to avoid getting stuck. 
**Be considerate of busy commuters.** Parisians spend 1-2 hours commuting daily. Step aside if you don't know where you're going to let others pass efficiently during rush hours.
**Only buy tickets from authorised booths and machines.** Random people may try to sell you invalid tickets - it's a common scam. The official way is the safe bet. 
**Get a Navigo Easy card.** Previously tickets were the norm, but cards that you can top up are now widely used for convenience.

### Getting Around by Bus, Foot and More 
Paris has one of the most compact and walkable city centers. Consider alternative options to the metro as well:
**Walk when possible.** Many spots are closer by foot than taking the metro one or two stops. Enjoy exploring neighborhoods. 
**Use the bus network.** Buses may be faster than walking long distances, and you see more scenery than underground. Just brace for fast stops. 
**Check last metro times carefully.** After closing, options are limited except for expensive taxis or night buses with rowdy riders. Plan accordingly. 
[Avoid busy metro lines at rush hour](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-28-vie-quotidienne-xe0-panama/) such as line 13 known locally as the "cattle wagon." Your trunk doesn't need that stress either - take buses instead if possible.
## Eating and Shopping Like a Local
Parisians know the best spots off the beaten path. Here are some insider dining and shopping tips:
### Finding Great Food Beyond the Tourist Traps
Get out of your comfort zone and experience the authentic flavors of Paris. 
**Picnic along the Seine or in parks.** Stop at a market for baguettes, cheese, fruit and wine for an affordable al fresco meal. 
**Dine early, around 7-7:30pm.** You'll better chances of a table and servers have more time to help before the late dinner rush. 
**Ask for tap water.** The tap water is safe to drink, saving money versus bottled water. 
**Try classic dishes like quiche, escargots or steak tartare.** Get out of your food comfort zone for new tastes. 
### Shop Local and Save on Reservations
Support independent shops and save effort with some restaurant booking strategies:
**Browse marche aux puces flea markets.** Find unique vintage treasures and bargains versus tourist goods.
**Book restaurants in advance using The Fork app.** Sometimes score discounts versus unsure walk-ins during prime dinner hours.
**Arrive at 7pm if no reservation.** You may get a earlier-than-planned table as sometimes reservations fall through. 
## Behaving Like a Respectful Visitor
Parisians can seem aloof but are generally friendly with a little effort on your part:
**Greet staff when entering stores "Bonjour".** It's polite versus being ignored for rudely barging in.
**Don't stand in metro doorways or busy areas.** Be courteous of locals navigating crowded stations. 
**Speak some basic French phrases.** Locals will appreciate you making an effort with "Merci" and "Parlez-vous anglais?".
**Tip 5-10% for good service.** Tips are a nice gesture versus automatic like in the US, based on service quality. 
**Relax and enjoy the atmosphere.** Meals in Paris are experiences, not rushed. Order a coffee if really pressed for time.
With these insider strategies, you'll feel more like a Parisian during your visit versus just a tourist. Bon voyage!
