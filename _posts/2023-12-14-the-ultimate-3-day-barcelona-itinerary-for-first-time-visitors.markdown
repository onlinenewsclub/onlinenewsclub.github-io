### Getting Around Barcelona on Public Transport
One of the most important tips for visitors to Barcelona is to purchase a T-10 card from any metro station. The T-10 card allows you to take **10 connected journeys on the metro, bus or tram** for just over 10 euros, which is by far the cheapest way to get around the city. Barcelona has an excellent public transportation system that will take you to all the top attractions and neighborhoods. Allow plenty of time for journeys to and from the airport, as there can sometimes be delays due to strikes or police checks.

### Day 1: Exploring Gracia and the Eixample District
Start your first day in the charming neighborhood of Gracia. Wander through the lovely squares and take in the local vibes away from the tourist crowds. Make your way down Passeig de Gracia towards Gaudi's modernist masterpieces La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. After visiting one of these architectural wonders, continue on to bustling Plaça de Catalunya, the city's central hub. Walk along the famous Las Ramblas promenade, taking in the street performers and human statues along the way. Be sure to stop for photos in front of Christopher Columbus at the end of the avenue. Have a stroll along the Barcelona harbor boulevard for scenic views of the water.  
### Walk Along the Beach from Diagonal Mar to Barceloneta

Wander the charming back streets filled with authentic Spanish charm before the day ends.
### Explore the Artsy Born and Ribera Districts

The area has a hip, artsy vibe with multiple art galleries and craft breweries worth checking out. Next, stroll through La Ribera north of Born, an unspoiled neighborhood with lovely architecture and cafes. Don't forget to see the architecture of Palau de la Música Catalana, considered a symbol of Catalan modernism.

### Relax In Collserola Park and Vallvidrera
Wake up refreshed on the third day to catch the funicular rail up the Collserola Park hillside. Get off at the **Passeig de les Aigües** midway stop for scenic views of Barcelona and a leisurely two-hour walk along wooded trails. Keep an eye out for joggers taking in the fresh air. If you get lost along the way, simply follow signs downhill back towards the city center. For an alternative explore, journey all the way to the charming mountain village of Vallvidrera tucked within the greenspace. Savor the natural beauty surrounding Barcelona one last time before departing.
### Admnire Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Before Heading Home

Allot a few hours to admire the soaring spires and intricate exterior details even if you can't go inside due to long lines. Consider reserving online tickets in advance to explore the interior if time allows. From there, wander over to stay for dinner in El Born or the Gothic Quarter before wrapping up your whirlwind Spanish adventure. With a blend of top attractions, local neighborhoods and natural escapes over three days, this itinerary hits the highlights of what makes Barcelona such a splendid destination.
