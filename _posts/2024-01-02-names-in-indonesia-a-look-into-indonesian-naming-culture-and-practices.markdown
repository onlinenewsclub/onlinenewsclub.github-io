Indonesians often only use a single name, either in their identification cards or passports. But what does this mean exactly? Let's take a deeper look at Indonesian naming conventions.
### The Use of Single Names
While some assume single names imply only one word, this is not necessarily the case for Indonesians. **Most names consist of two parts - a first name and a surname.** There are some with only one word names, but two-part names are more common. Names in older generations from the 1980s-1990s sometimes included middle names as well. Younger generations today tend to have longer, more creative names with 4-5 parts. 
Importantly, Indonesian surnames are not always patronymic like in Western cultures. They can simply be an additional name not tied to the father. Examples include former president Sukarno's children using "Putra" or "Putri" as surnames meaning "son" or "daughter".

### Flexibility in Names on Passports and Documents
Indonesian identity cards, passports, degrees, marriage certificates, and death certificates will all reflect the same single name. However, there is flexibility allowed. One's name can be legally changed by reporting it to local police and obtaining court approval. 
Passports also do not have strict name requirements. Even one-letter names will be issued as long as other conditions are met. This contrasts with places like Saudi Arabia that expect foreigners to have **three-part names** for visa approval.
### Evolving Trends in Indonesian Names  
In recent decades, there has been a perception that longer, more unique names signify higher social status. Younger generation parents today strive to give their children such **"classy"[ and ](https://ustoday.github.io/2024-01-11-le-drapeau-tch-xe8que-et-le-coin-slovaque-l-histoire-les-accords-et-la-relation-entre-la-r-xe9publiq/)"complicated"** names with 4-5 parts mixed with foreign elements like German. However, names alone no longer clearly identify children's economic backgrounds.
### Issues with Names on Documents 
Mistakes can sometimes occur when transcribing names onto legal documents.

Repeated requests to correct this were denied, causing issues when marrying internationally. 
### Common Name Structures among Ethnic Groups
Most native Indonesians traditionally have two-part names, with surnames rarely being just one word. Meanwhile, Chinese Indonesians commonly have their surname as the first name part and another name as the last part. Around half also put their surname last instead of first. Overall, three-part names with the surname last are prevalent among Chinese Indonesians.
### Conclusion
This overview looked at Indonesian naming conventions, structures common among ethnic groups, allowed flexibility and past/present trends. While simplification on documents was an issue in the past, names today reflect diverse multicultural influences shaping Indonesian identity. A name's perceived meaning continues to evolve along with society.
