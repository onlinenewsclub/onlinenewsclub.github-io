### Planning and Safety Considerations 
As a member of the US military, [international travel requirements](https://thetopnews.github.io/how-blizzard-manages-world-of-warcraft-server-infrastructure/) and safety briefings from your chain of command are extremely important when considering a trip across the border. Times have changed significantly due to the ongoing pandemic, and travelers now face increased scrutiny and documentation checks. It's critical to understand all legal documentation needed like a valid US passport and to receive the most up-to-date **travel safety briefing** on regulated areas from your base's intelligence officers. Approval from senior leadership is also usually required without an essential purpose. Proper planning eliminates risks and ensures a smooth crossing experience.

### Valid Travel Documents 
While a US military ID is valid identification domestically, it does not substitute as a **valid travel document** for international destinations like Mexico. Only a valid US passport or passport card can be used when entering by land or sea. Dependents also need passports regardless of a service member's ID status. Within NATO countries, a military leave form plus ID may suffice for short trips if not stationed there, but Mexican border security only accepts passports. Obtaining the right travel documents ahead of time prevents last-minute issues and denial at the border. 
### Changes at the Border in Times of Crisis
The border environment has changed drastically in light of the pandemic. In non-crisis times, regularly crossing between areas like Tijuana was more accommodating for personal trips with few questions asked if presenting the right ID or documents. Now, border agents have a narrower focus on essential travel only with full ID/passport documentation in hand ready to scan. Simply flashing a military ID is insufficient unlike past years. Travelers must prove a clear need to cross back and forth currently. Flexible rules tightened up substantially during times of international health or other crises.
### Consulting the Experts on Border Policy 
For the most accurate border policy information, a traveler's immediate chain of command maintains currency on Mexico entry stipulations through their intelligence staff and relationships with border enforcement. Base S2 sections closely monitor border agency directives and can provide case-specific guidance on permitted travel. Outdated web searches or hearsay from peers may give false impressions about current admissibility standards set by Mexico and CBP. The experts in a traveler's organization keep abreast of any travel bans to high-risk states or other travel advisory changes. Official consultation avoids reliance on stale third-party information.
### International Trip Safety Considerations 
Even with approved travel, safety remains a top concern abroad. Briefings from intelligence outline safety precautions like avoiding unattended areas in border regions or southern Mexico states facing cartel violence. Valuables and documentation get stored securely while outside the US. Communication arrangements get set in the event of an emergency. Travel in groups when possible. Though policies tighten, approved international trips can still offer enjoyable cultural experiences. With proper planning through the chain of command and using trip safety basics, approved travel poses manageably low risk.
### Conclusion 
The best approach for any US service member considering Mexico travel involves consulting their chain of command intelligence experts on current border documentation mandates and safety briefings for destinations. Relying on outdated websites for policy information sets travelers up for hassles or denials. Proper documentation, approval, and planning eliminates most risks and ensures a smooth legal crossing experience, whether for essential travel or approved personal time abroad. Following standard procedures protects the traveler while respecting the host nation's sovereignty.
