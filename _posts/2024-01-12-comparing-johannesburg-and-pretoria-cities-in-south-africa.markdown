### Choosing the Right City for Your Needs
South Africa has diverse cities to choose from for living and doing business. Johannesburg and Pretoria are two of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Each city has its strengths depending on your priorities. 
Johannesburg is the economic hub of South Africa and offers more employment and investment opportunities compared to other cities. **However, parts of inner Johannesburg and some surrounding areas like Hillbrow have higher crime rates** due to their urban density. Staying in the leafy and safe suburbs provides a higher quality of living. 
Pretoria, as the administrative capital, is preferable for doing business with the South African government. Despite being a major city, **Pretoria has a less crowded feel than Johannesburg with a relatively lower cost of living.** Safety seems to be better residing in Pretoria compared to Johannesburg's city center.

### Comparing Amenities, Entertainment and Lifestyle 
Both Johannesburg and Pretoria have extensive amenities, malls, restaurants and entertainment options due to their large populations. **Leisure activities for families, youth and professionals are plentiful with cinemas, parks, sporting venues and more.** 
The suburbs in all directions stretch for miles with repeated community centers in both cities. Depending on proximity to work and income level, different suburban areas suit varying budgets and lifestyles. 
International schools, hospitals and infrastructure support residents and businesses well. Urban sprawl makes having a vehicle necessary for transportation within the cities. Public transportation connects some areas but has room for improvement.
### Safety Considerations When Living in South African Cities
Safety should be a top concern when choosing where to reside long-term in South Africa. While crime exists worldwide, some South African areas warrant extra precaution. 
In Johannesburg specifically, steering clear of the inner city and Hillbrow neighborhood is advised due to higher criminal activity there. For Pretoria, areas like Sunnyside, Arcadia and Pretoria West carry risks and should be avoided if possible. 
On the whole, South African cities compare reasonably well to major urban hubs internationally on safety. Simple safety measures make a big difference, like avoiding deserted areas at night, not displaying expensive possessions openly, and using guarded housing complexes and transports where possible.
### Expansive Suburban Living Within Commutable Distance   
The sprawling suburbs around both Johannesburg and Pretoria extend the viable living areas significantly beyond the cities' boundaries. Well-established bedroom communities provide affordable, spacious family housing still within commutable distance to major employment zones.
Gated communities, security systems and neighborhood watches enhance security in the suburbs compared to inner areas. **Good schools, shopping malls, sporting facilities and open spaces attract residents seeking a balanced lifestyle at a reasonable cost.** Access to major highways integrates the peripheral areas seamlessly within the wider metros.
### Overall Comparison and Recommendations
Weighing career, investment and safety priorities helps determine whether Johannesburg or Pretoria suits needs better as a South African home base. Johannesburg leads for business scale but requires more vigilance in location choices.  
**Pretoria presents a calmer environment comparatively near key government connections.** Both deliver extensive amenities alongside drawbacks like heavy road use needs. Overall either metro works well with attentiveness to the caveats in each. With care, South African living compares favorably to international cities.
So in summary, for business Johannesburg stands out while Pretoria edges ahead on administration access and livability arguably. Ultimately individual assessment of one's unique situation guides the best selection between these two impressive South African cities. Care, common sense and community connections help optimize quality of life anywhere.
