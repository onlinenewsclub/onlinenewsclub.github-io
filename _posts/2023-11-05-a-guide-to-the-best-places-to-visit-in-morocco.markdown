Morocco is a fascinating country with a rich culture and stunning landscapes. From iconic cities like Marrakech and Fez to charming coastal towns and the majestic Atlas Mountains, there is something for every type of traveler. Here is a guide to some of the top destinations in Morocco and tips on how long to spend in each place.
### Exploring the Imperial Cities 
Morocco's imperial cities offer a glimpse into the country's rich history and traditions. [Fez](https://elviaje.github.io/2024-01-09-xbfir-xe1n-un-pa-xeds-sorprendente/), the spiritual and cultural capital, should not be missed. Wandering through its medieval **medina** is a highlight. While 3 days allows time to see the main sights, I found 2 days was sufficient to experience Fez. **Casablanca** is Morocco's largest city but lacks character - spend 1-2 days there before moving on to more interesting destinations. **Marrakech** lives up to its image as the most vibrant of Morocco's cities. Plan for 3-4 days to fully immerse yourself in its **bustling souks** and lively **Ja√¢ma El Fna square**. Be sure to take a day trip to the nearby **Ourika Valley** for scenic mountain views.

### Enchanting Coastal Towns 
The Atlantic coast offers a relaxed escape from the big cities. **Essaouira** is a lovely medieval port town with a laidback atmosphere. Its **ramparts** overlooking the sea and **hippie culture** give it a charming atmosphere unlike anywhere else. One afternoon here is enough if you aren't a surfer taking advantage of its breaks. **Tangier** located near the Strait of Gibraltar draws in international visitors. Its cosmopolitan flair makes for an interesting half day stop. Both coastal destinations make for welcome breaks between bigger cities.
### Remote Desert Destinations  
Venturing into Morocco's vast desert regions rewards with striking scenery and unique cultural experiences. **Ouarzazate** nicknamed 'Hollywood of Africa' due to hosting many film productions is a great place to overnight. Explore its elaborate **kasbahs** used as filming backdrops. Further south, the remote town of **Tan-Tan** offers a glimpse of traditional Saharan life. Both destinations are worth spending a full day exploring before continuing on to your next destination. While not along the route, a detour to **Merzouga** allows you to experience the magical **Sahara desert** by taking a overnight camel trek under the stars.
### Picturesque Mountain Towns
Nestled in the dramatic Atlas Mountains, small towns provide memorable cultural experiences. The UNESCO world heritage listed town of ** Chefchaouen** is unforgettable with its **azure-washed walls** and **majestic setting** surrounded by forested peaks. Spend at least a full day here wandering the alleys. Similarly enchanting is **Ifrane**, known as the "Little Switzerland of Morocco", with scenic pine forests and traditional **Kasbahs**. Both mountain hideaways are worth overnighting in for a true taste of rural Moroccan life away from larger tourist spots.
### Majesty of the Atlas Mountains  
Morocco's towering Atlas Mountains should not be missed when traveling through the country. Taking the scenic mountain route from Fes to Marrakech is a highlight, passing through the magnificent **Middle Atlas Mountains**. Be sure to stop in the picturesque villages along the way, where you'll receive a warm welcome from locals. Another option is the breathtaking **High Atlas Mountains** near Marrakech offering excellent short hikes. Whether you're driving or taking local transport, spending a few extra days stopping in the various Atlas towns and villages en route to your main destinations will reward you with spectacular scenery and cultural encounters off the beaten path. The Atlas Mountains showcase Morocco's natural beauty.
### Final Recommendations
To summarize the optimal route and time allocation: Spend 2-3 days in Fez, 1 day in Casablanca, 3-4 days in Marrakech including a day trip to Ourika Valley. Take 1-2 days experiencing Essaouira and Chefchaouen's charm. Overnight in the desert towns of Ouarzazate and Tan-Tan. Slow down and spend scenic extra days passing through the Atlas Mountains between destinations. With the right balance of historic cities, coastal escapes, desert adventures and mountain beauty - you'll experience a well-rounded introduction to Morocco in 2 exciting weeks. Be sure to stay in Riads and Kasbahs for an authentic cultural experience. Buen viaje!
