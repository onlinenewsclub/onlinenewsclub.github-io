### Halloween Fun in September
We recently traveled to Singapore in September with our toddlers aged 2 and 4. [One of the surprising benefits of visiting in September was all the early Halloween activities and themes](https://wordtimes.github.io/2024-01-09-die-kosten-eines-urlaubs-auf-den-bahamas/). When we went to the SEA Aquarium, the kids could go trick-or-treating and were given pumpkin baskets to collect candies from staff. They absolutely loved it! Universal Studios also had many Halloween elements like Minions in costumes. As a family that loves Halloween, this was a huge plus for us even though it wasn't yet October.

### Less Crowds and Private Tour Experience 
Our tour guide mentioned that September isn't as busy a time. We experienced this firsthand when we were the only ones on our bus tour, so it felt like a **private tour experience**. Lines at Universal Studios also tended to be shorter. Having fewer people around made exploring Singapore more enjoyable with young children in tow.
### Pleasant Weather Without Summer Heat
The weather in September is less hot and humid compared to the summer months. It was still rainy season, so an umbrella was handy on the occasional rainy day. However, **none of our planned activities or itinerary were disrupted due to rainfall**. The milder temperatures made getting around the city more comfortable with kids.
### Festive Atmosphere in June to August 
The best months overall to visit Singapore with family are June through August as well as December to January. During these periods, temperatures range from the high 20s to low 30s Celsius with low rainfall. You can take part in many festivals like the **Singapore Arts Festival and Singapore Food Festival**, creating a lively atmosphere perfect for traveling with children. 
### Great for Zoo and Theme Park Visits
Another advantage is that local school holidays differ from those in other countries. Hence, attractions like the four zoos, Universal Studios, and NEW Zoo won't be as crowded if you visit outside of June and November through early December. Late March through July/August as well as October tend to have lighter crowds at popular kids' spots. 
### Chinese New Year Peak Season
Be prepared for larger crowds if visiting during Chinese New Year in late January or February. Book accommodations far in advance for this festive period. Overall, scout school holiday dates to find the best times of year to balance mild weather and fewer crowds when exploring top family-friendly attractions in Singapore.
