### **Take in Panoramic City Views from Tokyo Skytree and Tokyo Tower** 
For incredible views of Tokyo's sprawling cityscape, head to Tokyo Skytree or Tokyo Tower. Tokyo Skytree offers the best views in the city from its two observation decks 450 and 350 meters up. Go at night to see the mesmerizing glow of lights below. Tokyo Tower located in Shiba Park is iconic for its orange and white architecture. Though some say it's overrated, its views are still beautiful, especially at night. Beat the crowds with an early morning or late evening visit.  
### **Experience the Fresh Seafood Bounty at Tsukiji Fish Market**
One of Tokyo's top attractions is the famous Tsukiji Fish Market. Go early in the morning, around 5-6am, to experience the frenetic auction where wholesale dealers bid for the overnight seafood catches. After the auctions finish, surrounding shops and restaurants serving sushi, sashimi and donburi rice bowls open for breakfast. This is a fantastic opportunity to try some of the freshest and best seafood in Tokyo at very reasonable prices. Be sure to also check out the numerous stalls selling Japanese kitchen knives and other goods.  
## Exploring Kyoto
### **Hike Through Arashiyama's Bamboo Forest and Take a Boat Ride on Ōi River**  
A beautiful suburban area located on the western outskirts of Kyoto, Arashiyama is known for its scenic bamboo grove and the calm Ōi River. The annual changing shade of green in the bamboo forest offers a serene escape from the busy city life. You can also relax by renting a boat and drifting down the peaceful river waters while appreciating the picturesque scenery along its banks. Make sure to visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the biggest crowds.
### **Soak up the History and Architecture of Golden Pavilion and Kinkaku-ji Temples**
Kyoto is renowned for its numerous exquisite Buddhist temples, with Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) Temple and Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion) Temple ranking among the most popular attractions. Kinkaku-ji, located northwest of Kyoto, features three floors covered in thin layers of pure gold and is beautifully reflected in its surrounding pond. Nearby Ginkaku-ji, though lacking Kinkaku-ji's gold leaf exterior, boasts similarly landscaped gardens that are worth lingering in. Allow at least half a day to properly experience these historical sites.
### **Stroll Through Higashiyama's Atmospheric Streets and Visit Kiyomizu Temple** 
The scenic Higashiyama district in eastern Kyoto is perfectly suited for a leisurely stroll. Explore the charming backstreets dotted with traditional inns, gardens and restaurants. A highlight is Kiyomizu Temple standing on a wooden stage elevated over the hills, offering great photo opportunities of its huge wooden pillars and sweeping views. Continue downhill along the famous "Philosopher's Path" which leads through lovely scenery before emerging at the lively downtown area.
## Exploring Hiroshima
### **Pay Your Respects at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum**  
Remembering the horrific effects of the atomic bomb dropped in 1945, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum are poignant places to visit. The bombed shell of the Industrial Promotion Hall nicknamed "Genbaku Dome" stands as a memorial. Within the well-maintained park dotted with memorials, you'll also find the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum containing disturbing yet essential wartime exhibits and survivor testimony. Make an effort to understand the profound impact on humanity during your contemplative visit here.
### ** visit Itsukushima Shrine Set on the Waters of Miyajima Island**
A short ferry ride from Hiroshima takes you to the beautiful island of Miyajima, known for its majestic red torii gate that seems to float on water at high tide. Itsukushima Shrine set in the scenic rocky coast and pine forests is considered one of Japan's most picturesque Shinto shrines. You can also spot wild deer and momiji maple trees adding stunning autumn colors. Best visited as a day trip from Hiroshima, allow some time to wander around the serene island taking in gorgeous coastal and forest scenery.  
### **Sample Local Cuisine Such as Okonomiyaki and Oysters**
Foodies should be sure to try some Hiroshima specialties during their visit. Okonomiyaki, a hearty savory pancake typically filled with cabbage, noodles and choice of meat or seafood is a Hiroshima icon. It's fun to cook it yourself at the table on a large griddle. You also can't miss sampling the region's delicious fresh oysters, either grilled on skewers or simply served raw with soy sauce. Wash it all down with a mug of draft Asahi beer for the full local experience.
## Venturing Beyond the Main Cities
### **Explore the Natural Beauty and Onsen of Hakone Region**
Situated between Tokyo and Mt. Fuji, Hakone is a scenic area filled with hot springs, lakes, valleys, and forests. Highlights include a scenic lake cruise on Ashino-ko, views of Mt. Fuji from Owakudani “Great Boiling Valley”, and soaking in outdoor rotenburo onsen overlooking nature. Many ryokan inns here have private indoor and outdoor hot spring baths. All provides a relaxing respite from busy city life. Opt to stay overnight and truly unwind in the peaceful, soothing surroundings. 
### **Discover the Rural Charm of Shikoku Island**
The more remote Shikoku Island offers a taste of traditional rural Japan, ideal for those seeking an off-the-beaten-path experience. The Iya Valley is particularly scenic, surrounded by cliffs where you can enjoy hot springs or walk along riverside paths. Accommodations here range from basic to upscale ryokan inns. Getting around requires some planning using local trains and buses, but it's rewarding to uncover hidden gems away from crowds. Make a multi-day itinerary to fully unwind in Shikoku's idyllic natural scenery.
### **Wind Down in the Historic City of Nara**
Situated close to Kyoto and Osaka, Nara makes for an easy day trip. However, it's scenic parkland and temples warrant at least an overnight stay to truly relax. Set loose herds of friendly deer roam Nara Park where you'll find Todai-ji Temple, home to the largest bronze Buddha statue in Japan. Don't miss nearby Kasuga Taisha Shrine, noted for its hundreds of stone and bronze lanterns. Wander through Nara's atmospheric streets to glimpse traditional architecture and absorb the laidback pace of a historic former capital city.
