### The Grand Mosque of Makkah: A Sanctuary for Millions 
The [Grand Mosque of Makkah](https://logurl.github.io/2024-01-04-u53cc-u76ee-u89c2-u89c8-u5df4-u62ff-u9a6c-u8fd0-u6cb3/) spans an area of over 400,000 square meters and can accommodate up to two million worshippers at once under its roof and in the open courtyards. In addition to the original structure, the **Saudi government** has added several basement levels, floors, and open spaces over the years to facilitate the ever-increasing number of pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah. The mosque now towers over Makkah's skyline with its multi-tiered white marble exterior and numerous minarets. 
### Worshipping Before the Sacred Ka'aba 
At the center of the Grand Mosque lies the holiest site in Islam - the **cubic building of Ka'aba**. Enveloped in a black silk-cloth adorned with gold-embroidered verses from the Quran, the Ka'aba stands empty inside with only a few lamps hanging from the ceiling. Pilgrims circumambulate the structure seven times and pray facing it as the focal point of their worship. Nearby are safely barricaded areas where pilgrims can pray close to the station of Ibrahim.
### State-of-the-Art Facilities for Pilgrims
To efficiently accommodate millions yearly, the mosque has installed the latest amenities like lifts, escalators, underground parking, clean washrooms and praying areas. An underground city of corridors, tunnels and facilities stretches for kilometers. Teams of cleaners work round the clock to maintain the immaculate hygiene. Even at midnight, sections remain busy with worshippers in constant prayer and reflection within the sacred precincts.
### The Mosque of the Prophet: Centre of the Muslim World 
Located in the city of the Prophet's migration, the **Mosque of the Prophet in Madinah** is the second holiest site for Muslims. It was the place where the Prophet established the first Islamic community and state. The original structures that housed his humble dwelling and those of his companions have now been replaced with a modern expansion. 
### Praying Where the Prophet Prayed
One can sense the mosque's profound history simply by performing prayers where the Prophet himself prayed over 1300 years ago. At the rear is theRoza-e-Raqmatullah or the Prophet's chamber, which is now enclosed due to excessive reverence of some pilgrims. Nearby lie the tombs of his wives and family members. The mosque is continuously upgraded to serve the spiritual and practical needs of an average 3 million worshippers annually.  
### A Soul-Stirring Atmosphere of Peace
Despite the mammoth congregations, one experiences a soul-stirring serenity within its forecourts and prayer halls. People of all backgrounds earnestly perform their prayers and supplications side-by-side in an atmosphere saturated with faith, reflection and peace. Truly, these mosques act as powerful symbols and nerve centers of the global Muslim community.
