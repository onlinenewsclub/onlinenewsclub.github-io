Lagos, located in Nigeria, is Africa's most populous city with over 21 million residents. As the cultural, economic and financial center of Nigeria, it attracts many foreigners for tourism, business and other opportunities. However, due to its large population and challenges with infrastructure, safety can be a concern for visitors. This guide provides an objective overview of Lagos to help foreigners understand what to expect and how to stay safe while exploring this vibrant city.
## Traveling to and Around Lagos   
Moving around Lagos' streets takes strategy and patience due to heavy [traffic congestion](https://thetopnews.github.io/examining-ho-chi-minh-the-man-behind-the-myth/). Have a planned itinerary and know your destinations in advance. Consider hiring a driver familiar with the city. Public transportation like buses is also an option but can be crowded and delays are common. Download maps to navigate independently by car or **ride-hailing apps like Uber** provide a reliable option for point-to-point transportation.   
### Navigating Neighborhoods
Lagos is segmented into the mainland and islands. The **mainland** encompasses poorer, densely populated areas while the **islands like Victoria and Banana Island** are more affluent. Stay in hotels and visit neighborhoods according to your comfort level. Well-lit, populated areas tend to be safest during night travels. Use common sense like avoiding isolated streets after dark.

### Alternative Transportation  
When time is limited, pre-book airport pickups and accommodations.

Buses are another mobility option if brave enough to withstand crowded conditions. Just be aware of your surroundings and belongings.
