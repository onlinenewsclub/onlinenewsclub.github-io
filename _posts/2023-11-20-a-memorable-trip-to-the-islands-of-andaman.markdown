### Planning the Trip
I started planning my trip to Andaman [3 months in advance](https://pagetimes.github.io/2024-01-10-ubab0-ub3c4-ubc14-uc5ec-ud589-uac00-uc774-ub4dc/) to get the best flight deals. Booking early helped me save over 15k on airfare. As the islands have limited accommodation options, I directly contacted hotels in **Port Blair, Havelock and Neil Islands** to book rooms for different dates. This allowed me to choose budget friendly yet good quality hotels like **Hotel Shreesh, Gold India Beach Resort and Hotel C S Empire**.

### Reaching Port Blair
My flight journey included a layover in Kolkata. On arrival in Port Blair, I took a taxi to reach **Hotel Shreesh near Link Road**. Tired from the long journey, I spent the rest afternoon relaxing in my hotel. Corbyn's Cove beach is one of the popular attractions in Port Blair so in the evening I visited the beach to enjoy the scenic views before calling it a day.
### Exploring Around Port Blair
The next day, I went on an island hopping trip visiting **North Bay Island and Wiper Island**. While Wiper Island did not have much to offer, North Bay was breathtakingly beautiful. I enjoyed snorkeling here which gave me glimpses of the coral reefs and colorful sea life. Unfortunately, my planned visit to historic **Ross Island** was cancelled due to a VIP visit. In the evening, I went to see the iconic **Cellular Jail** to learn about the colonial prison through a light and sound show. 
### Journey to Havelock Island 
It was time to embark on a cruise to Havelock Island. I chose the private ferry service **Markruzz** known for its reliability and punctuality. The comfortable 2 hour journey on their air-conditioned ferry was enjoyable. In Havelock, I rented a vehicle and reached **Gold India Beach Resort** located near the popular beaches. After relaxing in my hotel, I spent the evenings exploring the pristine beaches witnessing magnificent sunrises and sunsets.
### Experiencing the Beaches of Havelock
During my stay in Havelock, I made the most of exploring its star attractions - **Radha Nagar Beach, Kala Patthar Beach and Vijay Nagar Beach**. Kala Patthar offered mesmerizing sunrise views early in the morning. Radha Nagar was the perfect place for beach activities like scuba diving amidst colorful coral reefs. Vijay Nagar also called the 'lover's beach' has secluded spots for quiet strolls. These picturesque beaches with fine white sand left me awe-struck with their beauty. Food options were mostly available at Radha Nagar where I enjoyed meals at beachside restaurants and shacks.
### Discovering Neil Island
It was time for another cruise, this time to **Neil Island aboard Sea Link ferry**. On reaching Neil, I checked into **Hotel C S Empire**, a comfortable accommodation near the jetty. Neil island has several stunning attractions accessible by vehicles or on foot within a small area. During my stay, I explored its pristine beaches like **Laxmanpur Beach 1** famous for unique rock formations and **Bharatpur Beach** ideal for snorkeling and water sports. Neil offered a more serene experience away from the crowds, making it one of the highlights of my trip.
### Back to Port Blair 
All too soon, my Island hopping trip came to an end as I boarded the Green Ocean 2 ferry back to Port Blair. In the evening, I engaged in some adventure doing parasailing at Corbyn's Cove beach. Soaking in the beauty of these islands was an utterly refreshing experience. With many unforgettable memories, I returned home feeling rejuvenated planning already for my next visit to the Andamans. Well-planned itineraries focusing on highlights along with easy commute options offered through reliable ferry services made this trip truly memorable. The exotic natural grandeur and lush tropical settings of these islands are a perfect getaway from city life.
