Though some criticized its effect on gentrification, the government invested in upgrades like decorations and regulations to preserve this cherished cultural hub.
### Hopping on Two Wheels  
The best way to navigate Nanning is via its efficient public transport or the growing number of shared bikes and electric bikes available for rent.

Charging stations dot the city, so you'll always have power to spare. With an ebike at your disposal, you can easily cover more ground each day to fully soak up everything Nanning has to offer.
