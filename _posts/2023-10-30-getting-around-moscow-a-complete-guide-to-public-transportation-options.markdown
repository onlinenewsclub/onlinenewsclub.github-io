### Topping Up Your Troika Card 
The [Troika travel card](https://thetopnews.github.io/page5/) is undoubtedly the most convenient payment method for using Moscow's extensive public transportation network. You can purchase an empty Troika card from any metro station booth or ticket machine for a refundable deposit of 50 rubles. Once you have your card, you'll need to add funds so you can start paying fares. Funds can be topped up at metro station terminals that accept both cash and credit cards. Be sure to only load as much money as you estimate needing for your fares, as the Troika card has a maximum balance limit of 3000 rubles.

### Discounted Fares with Troika Card Transfers
One of the greatest benefits of using a Troika card is qualifying for discounted transfer fares. The standard single ride fare is 38 rubles, paid by simply holding your Troika card up to the metro turnstile or terminal on surface transport. However, if you change forms of public transportation like transferring from metro to bus within 90 minutes, your second and subsequent rides in that time window will be discounted to only 21 rubles. This makes stringing together multi-modal trips very affordable.
### Using Your Phone to Pay on Moscow Transit  
For those comfortable with **contactless payments**, you can now pay fares directly from your smartphone using apps like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay linked to an eligible credit or debit card. Simply hold your phone up to the card reader and your account will be charged the standard 40 ruble fare. Over 80 metro stations across Moscow's expansive network currently support mobile payments. This convenient option is steadily expanding to cover all stations and forms of surface transit.
### Purchasing Multi-Ride Tickets
If you're planning on taking many trips in Moscow without concern for transfers, it can be worthwhile investing in a multi-ride paper ticket instead of constantly loading small amounts on your Troika card. Called "Yediny" tickets, they are valid for a preset number of rides over a 90 day period. Options range from a 2-ride ticket for 130 rubles up to a massive 60-ride pass for only 2650 rubles, working out to a lower per-ride cost than paying individually. Yediny tickets can also be restricted just to surface transport.
### Day Pass and Tourist Tickets 
Visitors looking to explore Moscow without worrying about individual fares each time should consider a daily, 3-day, or 7-day tourist pass. Ranging from 210 rubles for one day up to 800 rubles for a full week, these unlimited ride tickets cover all forms of public transport. They don't require a separate Troika card either. Tourist passes simplify budgeting your transport costs and allow spontaneous trips around the massive city. Just be aware the one-day pass only lasts until midnight on the date of validation.
### Using Cash on Buses and Trams 
While the Troika card reigns supreme in the metro, cash remains a widely accepted form of payment on Moscow's vast bus, tram, and trolleybus networks. The driver will be able to sell you a single-ride paper ticket for 50 rubles that is valid for 90 minutes of unlimited transfers. However, for multiple trips it's more affordable to pre-pay with a Troika card, Yediny ticket, or tourist pass if available. Surface transport routes can also vary regarding Troika card acceptance, so keep small bills on hand just in case. 
### Key Things to Remember
To summarize the transportation options and tips in Moscow:
- Purchase an empty Troika card and top it up as needed at metro stations for maximum convenience and discounted transfers
- Consider multi-ride Yediny tickets or tourist passes if staying more than a few days 
- Use contactless payment from apps like Apple Pay on eligible phones at expanding coverage areas  
- Carry some cash for rare occasions where only paper tickets are sold onboard buses/trams
- Keep your loaded Troika card handy at all times for subway gates and surface vehicle terminals
- Check balance and transfer history with station terminals if unsure of remaining credit
By following these guidelines, you'll have no trouble smoothly navigating Moscow's vast and efficient public transportation network during your entire visit using the most affordable methods. Let the Troika card be your travel passport to explore this immense city!
