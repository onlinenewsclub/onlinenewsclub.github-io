### Getting Settled In Seoul 
Seoul is a welcoming and safe city, but there are a few things you should know before your visit. When searching for accommodation, be aware that key money deposits in Korea can be very high, over $100,000 USD in some areas. After landing, the first step is to purchase a **T-Money Card** at a convenience store—this transit card allows you to pay for subway, buses and taxis. Download the [KakaoTalk](https://travelokla.github.io/2023-12-28-s-xe9curit-xe9-nocturne-xe0-jakarta/) app, as it's the dominant messaging platform in Korea. Get the subway map on KakaoTalk to easily navigate Seoul's excellent underground transportation system.

### Exploring Palaces and Royal Grounds
A great first stop is **Geongbokgung Palace** where you can spend hours wandering the beautiful grounds. Nearby attractions like **Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Village** and **Insadong** are also worth visiting in a single day. For stunning night views, hike up **Naksan Park** overlooking the city lights below. No trip to Seoul is complete without ascending **Namsan Tower** at the summit of Namsan Mountain. Visit the intriguing **Folk Museum** located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace to learn about traditional Korean culture and lifestyles. 
### Delving Into Food And Markets
Seoul has an abundance of delicious street foods to sample. Explore the vibrant **Namdaemun Market** stuffed with stalls selling fresh produce, household goods and prepared snacks. Other popular food destinations include the impressive food courts in department store basements like **Hyundai Department Store**. For inexpensive household items, **Namdaemun Market** and big box stores like **Emart** are excellent options. Don't forget to indulge in Korean specialties like **hallabong** oranges, **persimmons** and **jujubes**.
### Discovering Art, History and Culture 
The **National Museum of Korea** should not be missed, as it houses Korean art, relics and illustrates the country's rich history—and it's completely free to enter. Nearby, the** Hangul Museum** provides fascinating context around the development of the Korean language. Grab a ticket to a **professional baseball game** for a highly energetic experience with call-and-response cheering. **Insadong** alley is packed with art galleries and traditional teahouses offering tranquil respite from the busy city streets. 
### Embracing the Urban Landscape  
Take a **cruise along the Han River** for scenic city views, or visit the floating **Children's Grand Park** after dark for a magical water and light show. Ride the **KTX high-speed train** on a day trip down to the port city of **Busan** , about a 3 hour journey away. For panoramic vistas, ascend **Lotte World Tower**, the tallest building in Korea, though acrophobics may want to refrain from the glass skydeck. Nature lovers can hike peaceful trails at **Noryangjin Fish Market** or the forested slopes of **Bukhansan National Park**.
### Continuing the Journey
With over a week in Seoul, don't limit your itinerary just to the capital—consider shorter trips to surrounding areas. Visit the royal palaces, gardens and folk villages of **Suwon** , or travel east to admire the scenic coastline around **Gangneung** and its well-preserved **Haedong Yonggungsa Temple**. For a rural escape, head to the artistic island of **Jeju** , famous for its beaches, lava tubes, waterfalls and halls of wind. However you spend your time, Seoul offers a fascinating glimpse into modern and traditional Korean culture alike. With its people, food and natural beauty, the city will leave you wanting to return time and time again.
