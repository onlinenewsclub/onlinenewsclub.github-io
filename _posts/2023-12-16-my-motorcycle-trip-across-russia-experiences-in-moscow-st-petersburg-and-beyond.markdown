### Getting to Russia 
I set off on my motorcycle in May this year from the UK, riding east over the course of 9 days to reach Russia. Taking it slow and easy, I enjoyed scenic countryside views along the way. Crossing into Russia, I was prepared for lengthy border procedures, as I had heard the land crossing from Latvia could be tiresome. However, while checks and [duplicate paperwork submissions](https://wordtimes.github.io/2024-01-09-die-todesstrafe-im-kirchenstaat/) took time, officials treated Russians and foreigners alike.

### Exploring Moscow and Beyond
Upon reaching Moscow, I was struck by how **lush and green** the city had become - a transformation that locals said came earlier than typical. While there, I admired the colorful blooms of **cherry blossom trees**. From Moscow, I embarked on a month-long motorcycle adventure throughout western Russia. Over 4,000 miles, I visited historic cities like Volgograd while winding through charming rural towns and interacting with welcoming locals. Two polite traffic stops proved more curious than punitive as officers wished me well after routine checks. 
### Warm Hospitality Across Russia
Wherever I stayed - humble apartments, family homes, small inns or fancy hotels - I found accommodation to be comfortable and staff pleasant. Though an occasional money request from young strangers proved irritating, overall interactions left me feeling Russia was safe to explore freely. At roadside restaurants, filling plates of local cuisine replenished my energy for further riding. I enjoyed chatting with patrons and was struck by their openness despite my outsider status.
### St. Petersburg's Charms
Relocating to St. Petersburg for a time, I experienced city life among locals rather than as a fleeting tourist. Russians proved reserved with strangers yet deeply caring within friend groups. Generational divides shaped attitudes; boisterous youth contrasted stoic elders. An exception seemed stern **babushkas**, gruffly asserting space in queues! Family dining also differed subtly, like blunt refusals to adjust dishes. Yet strolling summer riversides revealed St. Petersburg's captivating artistic spirit through talented street musicians.
### Cultural Norms and Unique Experiences  
Interactions taught me Russians prioritize efficiency over **polite formalities**. While jarring for Westerners, this directness engenders trust within communities. Certain activities like **beef consumption** also reflect cultural preferences rather than prohibitions. Tourist sites understandably charge foreigners higher rates to offset local subsidies. With an open mind and respecting norms, I found Russians tolerant though disliking disruptive behaviors. One ought tread carefully seeking off-beat adventures, like our risky restaurant hunt, yet mild risks offered rich diversity in experience.
### Fond Memories of a Welcoming Russia
From those memorable weeks exploring Russia by motorcycle, I retain only positive impressions. Natural beauty amid urban bustle, hearty local fare, musical talents on display - such experiences leave me hoping to return someday. While norms differ and not all interactions proved comfortable, overall I felt welcomed. With empathy and willingness to understand varied perspectives, one can appreciate any culture on its own terms. Russia provided a glimpse into lives beautifully contrasting yet universally human. Those warm memories will stay with me across borders and through time.
