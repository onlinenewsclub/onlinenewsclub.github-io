### Starting the Journey from Delhi  
It was March 2021 when my friends and I decided to embark on an epic road trip from Delhi to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. With a distance of around 800 km between the two cities, we knew it would be a long one-day journey. However, the [beautiful desert scenery](https://thetopnews.github.io/a-look-at-the-changes-coming-to-ea-sports-fc-24/) and promise of adventure made it seem so worth it. We loaded up the car in Delhi around 10:30 pm, hoping to avoid traffic by starting our trip at night. The first leg to Rohtak passed by smoothly on smooth, empty roads under the moonlight.

### A Refreshing Stop in Bikaner
After Rohtak, there were no proper eating stops until Bikaner. We powered through the dark while snacking on food brought from home. By early morning, we arrived hungry in Bikaner city. A tasty **traditional Rajasthani thali** from a roadside dhaba hit the spot and reenergized us for the next leg. The colorful old city of Bikaner was just waking up as we passed through, giving us a brief glimpse of its **historic architecture** before hitting the road again.      
### Crossing the Desert Towards Pokhran
Leaving Bikaner behind, the landscape gradually transformed into arid desert as we drove towards Pokhran. Interesting rock formations started appearing on the roadsides, broken only by the occasional **camels grazing**. The **golden sands** stretching as far as the eye could see created a mesmerizing scene. We realized we had truly entered the land of sand dunes. Rolling on through flat, empty roads spotlighted Rajasthan's natural **rugged beauty**.
### Lunch in Pokhran Before the Final Stretch
After around 5 hours on the road from Delhi, we reached the town of Pokhran in time for lunch. Opting for filling Rajasthani **thalis and curries** once more, we replenished our energy levels. Pokhran is known for its proximity to the Rajasthan-Pakistan border and military base. However, it also holds some **colorful heritage sights** worth a brief stop. With our tummies full again, we hopped back in for the last leg to Jaisalmer through more scenic desert landscapes.  
### The Magic of Jaisalmer Appears! 
Crossing into Jaisalmer district, spectacular **sand dunes** started appearing up close. Imposing forts could also be spotted perched on hills. As we neared Jaisalmer city, the stunning yellow sandstone structures seemed to grow out of the desert itself. Passing under a majestic gateway, we found ourselves amidst the magical old city. Narrow lanes bustled with tourists, camels, shops and restaurants. Colorful **kutch work** designs decorated architecture on all sides. Our dayslong journey had finally brought us face to face with the magical Golden City of Jaisalmer.
### Conclusion
Our epic road trip from Delhi delivered on all fronts. We experienced majestic **desert landscapes** along newly constructed highways. The changing scenery kept us engaged throughout the long drive. Towns like Bikaner and Pokhran provided perfect breaks with tasty local food. Through this journey, we understood why Rajasthan is called the land of sand dunes and forts. Most of all, the magic of arriving in Jaisalmer city surpassed all expectations and was worth every kilometer travelled. I would highly recommend this memorable road trip through Rajasthan's **natural wonders** to fellow adventure travelers.
